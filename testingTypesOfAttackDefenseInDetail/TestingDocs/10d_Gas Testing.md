‚õΩ Gas Testing in Smart Contracts
Gas Testing is the process of measuring, comparing, and optimizing the gas consumption of smart contract functions. It ensures your contract is efficient, scalable, and resistant to denial-of-service (DoS) via gas exhaustion.

In smart contract development, gas cost = attack surface + user cost + protocol scalability risk. Testing gas usage reveals inefficiencies, gas bombs, and execution bottlenecks.

‚úÖ Types of Gas Testing
#	Type	Description
1	Static Gas Profiling	Measuring average gas used per function under standard inputs.
2	Fuzzed Gas Drift Testing	Detecting gas increases under mutated or randomized inputs.
3	Loop Bound Gas Testing	Testing how loops behave across different input sizes.
4	Proxy Gas Overhead Testing	Comparing gas use in proxy (delegatecall) vs direct contract logic.
5	Fallback Gas Testing	Measuring how gas is consumed in fallback() or receive() under unexpected inputs.
6	Reentrancy Gas Depth Testing	Determining if recursive calls deplete gas or bypass modifiers.
7	Batch Gas Testing	Simulating gas across batched/multicall sequences.
8	Cross-Contract Call Gas	Evaluating gas cost of call, delegatecall, staticcall across boundaries.
9	Upgrade Regression Gas	Comparing gas before and after upgrades for regressions.
10	Event Gas Testing	Measuring cost of event emission, especially with indexed fields.

‚öîÔ∏è Gas-Based Vulnerabilities Caught by Testing
Vulnerability	Description
Gas Bombs	Logic explodes in cost under large inputs (unbounded loops, fallback events).
DoS via Gas Limits	Function becomes uncallable when gas hits block limit.
Refund Lock	Overuse of selfdestruct/SSTORE prevents refunds from being paid.
Proxy Inefficiency	Upgrades degrade performance via logic bloat or redundant storage writes.
L2 Overflow	Chains like Arbitrum/Optimism enforce stricter calldata and gas compression.

üõ°Ô∏è Gas Optimization Practices
Strategy	Description
Memory caching	Store struct values in memory before mutating
Minimize SSTORE	Only write when values change (if (new != old))
Use unchecked	Disable overflow checks in trusted math
Loop caps	Hard-limit array iteration size
Consolidate writes	Batch multiple writes into one storage op
Minimal ABI	Avoid unnecessary parameters and types
