🧱 Constructor Tests in Smart Contracts
Constructor Testing ensures that a smart contract’s initial deployment logic behaves exactly as expected — setting the correct state, permissions, roles, and invariant values during the only-once run of the constructor().

🧠 In upgradeable contracts, constructor logic often moves to an initializer, but in both cases — initialization bugs can permanently lock a contract, misassign ownership, or break invariants.

✅ Types of Constructor Tests
#	Type	Description
1	Constructor State Initialization Test	Validate that variables set in the constructor (e.g., owner, token name) are correct.
2	Ownership / Role Assignment Test	Ensure correct permissions are assigned at deployment.
3	Immutable Variable Test	Confirm that immutable values are properly initialized.
4	Constructor Parameter Validation Test	Test edge values in constructor inputs (e.g., zero address, max values).
5	Constructor Revert Test	Ensure constructor reverts with invalid or unsafe input.
6	Event Emission on Construct Test	Check that events emitted in constructor are correct (if any).
7	Upgradeable Proxy Init Protection Test	Ensure constructor isn't bypassed on proxies (i.e., logic contract has no constructor).
8	Chained Constructor Logic Test	Validate inherited constructors correctly initialize all layers.
9	Storage Layout Initialization Test	Confirm storage slots are populated as expected post-deploy.
10	Clone Factory Init Test	For cloneable contracts, validate that initialize() mimics constructor correctly.

⚔️ Attack Types Caught by Constructor Tests
Attack Type	Description
Uninitialized Owner	owner set to zero or wrong deployer address.
Constructor Reentrancy	Unexpected callback inside constructor modifies state.
Zero Address Injection	Critical param passed as address(0) without validation.
Storage Drift on Init	Upgradeable contract doesn’t set required slots on init.
Missing Init Guard	initialize() is callable twice due to no initializer guard.
Incorrect Immutable Binding	Immutable used in logic but set incorrectly at deployment.
Proxy Constructor Confusion	Proxy ignores constructor, leaving contract uninitialized.
Parameter Drift	Parameters passed at deployment mutate logic unintentionally.

🛡️ Defense Types Enabled by Constructor Testing
Defense Type	Description
✅ Safe Initialization	Proves contract enters correct initial state.
✅ Ownership Assurance	Locks privileged logic to expected owner/admin.
✅ Immutable Binding Validation	Validates constructor sets unchangeable values correctly.
✅ Revert Safety at Deployment	Detects broken deployments early.
✅ Upgradeable Init Guard	Prevents proxy from uninitialized logic.
✅ Role Injection Hardening	Ensures caller or inputs can't elevate themselves.
✅ Storage Consistency	Detects layout misalignment in slot placement.
✅ Factory Clone Setup	Ensures clones mirror constructor logic via initialize().
