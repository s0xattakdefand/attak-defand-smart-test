📡 Event-Based Testing in Smart Contracts
Event-Based Testing ensures that your smart contract emits the correct events, with correct parameters, in the correct order, during execution. It's essential for:

✅ Verifying on-chain behavior

🛰️ Supporting off-chain indexers (e.g., The Graph, Dune)

📉 Preventing event-based frontends from desyncing with reality

⚠️ If your event emits but the state is wrong, that’s a silent bug. Event-based tests catch this.

✅ Types of Event-Based Testing
#	Type	Description
1	Event Emission Assertion	Confirm a specific event was emitted.
2	Argument Matching Assertion	Check that emitted arguments match expected values.
3	Indexed Topic Validation	Ensure indexed parameters are correctly logged.
4	Order of Events	Validate multiple events are emitted in correct sequence.
5	No-Emit Assertion	Ensure that no event was emitted when it shouldn't be.
6	Cross-Contract Emit Check	Detect that an event was emitted by a delegatecall or external call.
7	Event-Driven State Assertion	Confirm that emitted event data matches contract storage state.
8	Upgrade Event Regression Test	Check that event names/signatures remain consistent after upgrade.
9	Fallback Emission Guard	Ensure fallback functions don’t emit misleading events.
10	Replay Safety Validation	Validate events can't be replayed to mislead listeners or bots.
