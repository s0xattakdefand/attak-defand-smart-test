üåê Fork Testing in Smart Contracts
Fork Testing allows you to test your contracts using a live fork of a real blockchain network (e.g., Ethereum mainnet, Arbitrum, Optimism). It provides a real-world execution environment with:

üß© Existing token balances

üß† Live contract bytecode

üîÑ On-chain state, liquidity, oracles, governance proposals

It is essential for audit-grade validation, cross-chain testing, simulation of real exploits, and production deployment dry-runs.

‚úÖ Types of Fork Testing
#	Type	Description
1	Mainnet Fork Testing	Fork Ethereum mainnet to test against real token balances, pools, and protocols.
2	L2 Fork Testing	Fork Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, etc., to validate rollup-specific behavior.
3	Token/DeFi Fork Testing	Test with live Uniswap, Aave, or Curve contracts for integration or attack simulation.
4	Exploit Replay Fork	Replay known or fuzzed attack payloads against live forks.
5	Governance Fork Testing	Simulate DAO proposal lifecycle and voting execution using real proposal data.
6	Cross-Chain Fork Testing	Fork two chains (e.g., L1 + L2) and simulate bridging or messaging interactions.
7	Upgrade Dry-Run Fork	Simulate contract upgrade and verify state drift or selector changes in production.
8	MEV / Sandwich Simulation	Simulate real tx ordering, front-running, gas games using live mempool fork.
9	Vault/Strategy Validation	Deposit, withdraw, harvest, rebalance across real live DeFi positions.
10	Fallback Selector Replay	Fuzz or replay legacy call() data against fallback-enabled contracts on fork.
