üîó Integration Testing in Smart Contracts
Integration Testing ensures that multiple components of your smart contract system work together correctly ‚Äî including contracts, external calls (e.g., oracles, ERC20s), proxies, and permission flows. Unlike unit tests, integration tests simulate real-world interactions and execution paths across modules.

Integration testing is where you catch coordination failures, role mislinking, and cross-contract state drift ‚Äî things unit tests often miss.

‚úÖ Types of Integration Testing
#	Type	Description
1	Multi-Contract Flow Testing	Interactions across 2 or more contracts (e.g., Vault + Token + Strategy).
2	Cross-Function Integration	Testing sequences of multiple function calls across contracts.
3	Access-Control Flow Testing	Simulate role/permission movement across modules.
4	Proxy Upgrade Flow Testing	Validate that upgrades preserve state, selector behavior, and logic.
5	Token Transfer Flow	Confirm correct balances, approvals, and hook triggers across ERC20/ERC721.
6	Oracle & External Data Integration	Test integration with Chainlink or mock feeds.
7	MetaTx / Relayer Integration	Simulate full meta-transaction flow with signer, relayer, and forwarder.
8	Governance Execution Integration	DAO proposals, queue, vote, execute full-chain.
9	Multicall or Batch Execution	Validate order-sensitive batch effects and atomicity.
10	Cross-Chain Message Simulation	Simulate bridge or L2 ‚Üî L1 communication effects.

‚öîÔ∏è Attack Types Caught by Integration Testing
Type	Bug Caught
Role Drift	Admin role set in Vault but unused in Strategy
Storage Layout Drift	Upgrade breaks layout, mutates balance mapping
Proxy Delegate Bug	Call mutates proxy storage from wrong context
Reentrancy Path	Vault ‚Üí Strategy ‚Üí Vault call loop
Bad Approval	Vault doesn‚Äôt approve Token before transferFrom
Oracle Sync Bug	Price feed not updated in time before rebalance

üõ°Ô∏è Defensive Best Practices
Area	Best Practice
Proxies	Snapshot before & after upgrade, validate logic behavior
Token Paths	Simulate full ERC20/721 approve ‚Üí transferFrom flow
Role Movement	Test that access doesn‚Äôt leak across boundaries
Oracle	Mock price feeds with expected drift/revert
MetaTx	Test full signer ‚Üí forwarder ‚Üí contract execution
Batch Calls	Check state at each subcall stage and after rollback
