⛽ Gas-Use Assertion Tests in Smart Contracts
Gas-Use Assertion Testing ensures that specific smart contract functions consume predictable and bounded gas. These tests are essential to:

✅ detect gas regressions

✅ prevent DoS via gas exhaustion

✅ enforce efficiency constraints

✅ ensure L2 compatibility (where calldata/gas budgets matter)

🚨 In DeFi, NFTs, L2s, and gas-sensitive protocols, unexpected gas increases can break UIs, fail relays, or cause unexpected reverts due to stipend overuse.

✅ Types of Gas-Use Assertion Tests
#	Type	Description
1	Static Gas Limit Test	Assert a known function always uses ≤ X gas.
2	Gas Delta Regression Test	Compare gas usage before and after a code change or upgrade.
3	Loop Bound Gas Test	Validate that iteration size doesn't cause gas spike.
4	Calldata Size Drift Test	Track gas impact from large/mutated inputs.
5	Proxy Overhead Gas Test	Measure extra gas used by delegatecall/proxy pattern.
6	Fallback Gas Use Test	Ensure fallback doesn’t consume unbounded gas on unknown selector.
7	L2 Budget Enforcement	Assert function is within L2 gas limits (~200k on Arbitrum, <100k on Base).
8	Event Gas Use Test	Track gas use of event-heavy functions.
9	Cross-Contract Call Gas Test	Validate gas used across external/internal function boundaries.
10	Invariant Gas Trend Test	Monitor gas usage consistency across fuzzed inputs.

⚔️ Attack Types Prevented by Gas Assertion Tests
Attack Type	Description
Gas Bomb DoS	User sends large input or triggers loop causing failure by gas.
Proxy Inflation	Upgrade logic adds hidden gas overhead, breaking MetaTx or L2 relays.
Reentrancy via Fallback Gas Slack	Fallback leaves too much gas, allowing attacker to reenter.
Gas Refund Lockout	Contract misuses SSTORE, selfdestruct, or refund-heavy patterns.
Event Log Overhead	Overuse of indexed logs causes performance issues.
Loop Overflow	Loop iterates beyond expected bounds and runs out of gas.
L2 Unsafety	Function deploys or fails on rollups due to exceeded calldata/gas ratio.

🛡️ Defense Types Strengthened by Gas Tests
Defense Type	Description
✅ Loop Cap Enforcement	Ensures user input can't drive unbounded loops.
✅ Stipend-Constrained Safety	Confirms low-gas context (e.g. transfer()) still works.
✅ Gas Budget Regression Catcher	Ensures future refactors don’t increase gas silently.
✅ Fallback Gas Clamp	Limits fallback gas to prevent gas griefing.
✅ Proxy Predictability	Ensures proxies don’t degrade performance after upgrade.
✅ Storage Write Minimization	Detects excessive SSTORE and slot usage.
✅ Event Throttling	Verifies event logs don't spike gas via emit spam.
