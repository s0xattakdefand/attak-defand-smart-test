“**Storage/State Tests**” validate how your smart contract manages storage variables across different operations, ensuring correctness, consistency, and security.

## ✅ Types of Storage/State Tests (with explanation):

|  # | **Type**                           | **Description**                                                                               |
| -: | ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|  1 | **Initial State Test**             | Verify that state variables are correctly initialized after deployment.                       |
|  2 | **State Transition Test**          | Ensure that function calls cause correct state transitions (e.g. deposit increases balance).  |
|  3 | **State Invariant Test**           | Check that certain properties always hold true (e.g. `totalSupply == sum(balances)`).         |
|  4 | **Unauthorized State Change Test** | Simulate attacks where unauthorized users try to change critical state.                       |
|  5 | **Redundant State Write Test**     | Detect unnecessary storage writes that could be optimized or skipped.                         |
|  6 | **Persistent Storage Test**        | Validate that values persist correctly across transactions and calls.                         |
|  7 | **State Drift Detection Test**     | Compare expected vs actual state to detect unintended changes (e.g., due to reentrancy).      |
|  8 | **State After Revert Test**        | Ensure state is **not** mutated after a function reverts.                                     |
|  9 | **Mapping/Array Index Test**       | Check behavior of mappings or arrays, especially at boundary indexes.                         |
| 10 | **Multi-User State Test**          | Validate isolated state behavior across multiple users.                                       |
| 11 | **State Reset Test**               | Confirm functions like “reset” or “emergencyWithdraw” reset state correctly.                  |
| 12 | **Conflict Resolution Test**       | Ensure correct handling of overlapping writes (e.g., multiple roles accessing same variable). |
| 13 | **Storage Collision Test (Proxy)** | Validate that proxy and logic contracts don't have overlapping storage slots.                 |
| 14 | **Uninitialized Variable Test**    | Catch any usage of uninitialized storage pointers or structs.                                 |
| 15 | **Packed Storage Layout Test**     | Ensure expected layout for tightly packed storage variables (important for upgradeability).   |

## 📌 Common Attack Types Simulated

* 🧨 **Uncontrolled state change**
* 🕳️ **Storage slot collision**
* 🔁 **Reentrancy altering state mid-execution**
* 🎯 **State overwrite by untrusted input**

---

## 🛡️ Defense Strategies

* Use `assert`, `require`, and invariant-based assertions
* Use `slither` to validate layout and storage slot alignment
* Always **reset mappings/arrays** on re-initialization
* Use `immutable` for values that must not change
* Add **per-user isolation logic** in shared state access
