| Defense Strategy                 | Description                                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assertion Strengthening**      | Use `assert`, `require`, `expectRevert` with specific errors            |
| **Role Mocking With Control**    | Carefully simulate roles using `vm.startPrank` with controlled accounts |
| **Full Revert Coverage**         | For every `require`, write a test that confirms revert on failure       |
| **State Validation After Calls** | Always validate `storage` state changes after actions                   |
| **Event Assertions**             | Validate `emit` logs to ensure code path coverage                       |
| **Fuzz Entry Constraints**       | Use assumptions in fuzz/unit tests to prevent false positives           |
