üîÅ Regression Testing in Smart Contracts
Regression Testing ensures that new code changes or upgrades do not reintroduce old bugs or break previously working functionality. In smart contracts, regression testing is critical due to immutability, upgrade logic, and security guarantees that must remain consistent over time.

üö® Without regression tests, every deploy risks re-creating old vulnerabilities ‚Äî especially after refactors or proxy upgrades.

‚úÖ Types of Regression Testing in Solidity
#	Type	Description
1	Functional Regression	Re-testing known features (deposit, withdraw, vote) still behave the same.
2	Security Regression	Ensures previously patched bugs (e.g., reentrancy, overflow) are not re-exposed.
3	Upgrade Regression	Verifies that new implementations don‚Äôt break old storage, access, or logic.
4	Gas Regression	Compares gas usage before/after change ‚Äî no silent gas bombs introduced.
5	Event Regression	Emitted events and logs remain consistent for off-chain consumers.
6	Role/Permission Regression	Role configurations remain unchanged after deploy or upgrade.
7	Interface/ABI Regression	ABI remains backward compatible ‚Äî no removed/renamed functions.
8	Selector Behavior Regression	Function selectors map to same logic after upgrade or recompile.
9	Fallback Regression	Unhandled fallback/selectors don‚Äôt start triggering old logic.
10	State Drift Regression	Invariants and balances remain unchanged through upgrade or deploy drift.

‚öîÔ∏è Regression Risks in Smart Contracts
Risk	Bug Re-Introduced
Role removal	Owner or admin role lost after logic upgrade
Logic path changed	withdraw() now triggers legacy logic or drops checks
Selector shift	Selector now points to fallback or wrong function
Storage layout drift	Slot mappings misalign across proxy upgrades
Gas cost increase	Gas exceeds stipend for transfer() or claim()
Interface renamed	dApps or subgraphs break due to ABI mismatch

üõ°Ô∏è Regression Defense Practices
Practice	Description
Snapshot + Compare	Take state snapshot before and after deploy/upgrade
Invariant Regression Test	Ensure invariant_*() properties still pass
ABI Diffing	Use tools to compare function selectors, names, args
Storage Layout Freeze	Lock down slot positions with struct order + @custom:oz-upgrades
Event Schema Lock	Ensure event signatures are unchanged
Gas Snapshot Tools	Track gas before/after using Foundry‚Äôs --gas-report
