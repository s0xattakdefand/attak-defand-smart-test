üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ZK / MetaTx Testing in Smart Contracts
ZK (Zero-Knowledge) and MetaTx (Meta-Transaction) Testing verifies that contracts correctly validate off-chain proofs or signatures, and that transaction replay, role misuse, or signature drift is prevented across layers.

This is critical in systems that rely on:

‚úÖ Off-chain auth (signers, zkSNARKs, relayers)

‚úÖ Gasless transactions

‚úÖ Privacy-preserving access control

‚úÖ DAO vote, identity, or oracle proofs

‚úÖ Types of ZK / MetaTx Testing
#	Type	Description
1	MetaTx Signature Replay Test	Ensure each signed payload is used once (nonce or ID-based).
2	Domain Separator Drift Test	Test for replay safety across chains/contracts.
3	ZK Proof Validity Test	Verify contract correctly accepts only valid zk proofs (Groth16, Poseidon, etc.).
4	Relayer Bypass Test	Ensure that msg.sender is verified relayer and not attacker.
5	Signer Drift Test	Ensure signature matches the original intent and sender, not altered.
6	Hash Binding Test	Validate keccak256() or Poseidon inputs match intended scope.
7	EIP-712 Domain Separation Test	Ensure EIP712Domain is correct to block cross-contract signature abuse.
8	ZK Function Selector Guard	Confirm only zkProofs can unlock restricted logic (selector binding).
9	ZK Payload Fuzz Test	Feed malformed or partial proofs to ensure they‚Äôre rejected.
10	MetaTx Access Control Test	Simulate MetaTx calls from relayer and test correct access resolution.

‚öîÔ∏è ZK/MetaTx Attack Types
Attack Type	Description
Signature Replay Attack	A signed message is reused to trigger unintended logic.
Domain Drift Replay	Signature signed for Contract A is replayed on Contract B.
Relayer Bypass	Attacker pretends to be trusted relayer.
Poseidon Input Drift	Input drift makes ZK proof valid for multiple targets.
ZK Selector Drift	Proof unlocks unintended selector via fallback mutation.
Gasless Abuse	Malicious relayer spams valid txs to drain contract or user.
Cross-Chain Signature Replay	Same signature reused on another chain.
Timestamp-less ZK Proof	Proof valid forever; no expiry mechanism enforced.

üõ°Ô∏è ZK/MetaTx Defense Types
Defense Type	Description
Nonce Registry	Tracks per-user nonce to prevent reuse of signatures.
Domain Separator Binding	Signs over chainId, contract address, and version.
Relayer Whitelist	Restricts MetaTx to trusted oracles/relayers.
EIP-712 Compliance	Structured data with typehash and domain to ensure replay safety.
ZK Commitment Binding	Proofs tied to user, target, function, and timestamp.
ZK Expiry Enforcement	Include expiration in proof circuit or contract validation.
Signature Intent Hash	Signs over function selector, arguments, and gas.
Proof Replay Guard	Track hash of used ZK payloads and block reuse.
Multi-layer Verification	Double-check zkProof + signature + role on-chain.
Fallback Selector Lock	Only known selectors can be routed via ZK proof or fallback.
