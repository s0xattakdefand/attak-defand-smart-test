‚úÖ Positive Tests
Positive testing validates expected, successful behavior under correct inputs and conditions. It's the foundation of ensuring a smart contract‚Äôs normal execution paths are working as intended before testing for bugs or edge cases.

‚úÖ Types of Positive Testing
#	Type	Description
1	Functionality Tests	Verify basic expected outputs from contract logic (e.g., deposit, withdraw).
2	Role-Based Access Success	Test that the correct roles can perform privileged operations.
3	State Transition Tests	Check that contract state changes correctly under valid operations.
4	Event Emission Tests	Ensure that correct events are emitted with valid arguments.
5	Receive / Fallback Validations	Validate safe receipt of ETH or fallback behavior when expected.
6	ERC20/ERC721 Transfer Tests	Confirm transfers behave per token standard.
7	Permit/MetaTx Valid Signature Flow	Confirm valid signed payloads execute safely.
8	ZK Proof Acceptance	Valid zero-knowledge proofs are accepted and processed.
9	Upgrade Behavior	Confirm contract upgrade keeps behavior intact.
10	Boundary Value Validity	Test edge case inputs that are still within valid bounds.

‚öîÔ∏è Attack Types Prevented by Positive Tests
Attack Type	Prevention via Positive Test
Logic Regression	Tests catch if core function output or state is wrong after code change.
Storage Drift	Ensures proper storage mutations ‚Äî catches when state is corrupted.
Access Control Error	Prevents accidental permission removal or broken role mapping.
Broken Upgrades	Confirms new logic preserves working behavior from old version.
Event Drift	Detects when events stop emitting or emit incorrect data silently.
MetaTx/Permit Failures	Ensures signed actions execute only when valid.
Fallback Unexpected Activation	Validates fallback doesn't activate unintentionally under known calls.
Payment Misdirection	Asserts ETH/token transfers go to correct addresses.
Interface Drift	Catches changes that break interface logic, ABI mismatch, or frontend dependencies.
Revert Under Valid Input	Detects when valid input still causes revert unexpectedly.

üõ°Ô∏è Defense Types Enabled by Positive Testing
#	Defense Type	Description
1	Regression Guard	Protects against breaking functional features in upgrades.
2	Deployment Sanity Checks	Ensures contracts work in post-deploy state as intended.
3	Access Confidence	Confirms that only intended roles succeed ‚Äî not just attackers fail.
4	Invariance Proof of Function	Confirms that key outputs always result from valid inputs.
5	Interface Stability	Prevents breaking changes to callable logic (especially proxies).
6	Fuzz Path Anchoring	Serves as anchor path to verify expected fuzz outcome vs drift.
7	ZK Proof Reliability	Ensures valid proofs are accepted and can't fail randomly.
8	Upgrade Behavior Lock	Tests preserve expected behavior across versions.
9	Token Compliance Check	Prevents deviations from ERC20/ERC721 behavior.
10	Gas/Refund Path Validation	Confirms gas-sensitive or refund logic always triggers under correct input.
