| Type                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| 1. **Single-function Reentrancy**     | Attacker calls a function that re-enters the same function (e.g., `withdraw()` calls `msg.sender.call`, which triggers `withdraw()` again).                                                  |
| 2. **Cross-function Reentrancy**      | Attacker re-enters through another function within the same contract during the first call (e.g., `functionA()` calls external contract, attacker calls `functionB()` in the same contract). |
| 3. **Cross-contract Reentrancy**      | Reentrancy happens across multiple contracts â€” attacker re-enters from a different contract into the original one.                                                                           |
| 4. **Read-only Reentrancy**           | Exploits the assumption that `view` functions are safe, but state-changing behavior in other contracts alters their behavior mid-call.                                                       |
| 5. **Delegatecall Reentrancy**        | Occurs when using `delegatecall` to a malicious library that triggers a reentrant call back into the original contract.                                                                      |
| 6. **Constructor Reentrancy**         | Reentrancy triggered during construction phase of a contract when Ether is sent or logic is unexpectedly invoked before full deployment.                                                     |
| 7. **Cross-chain Reentrancy (Async)** | Occurs due to delayed settlement (e.g., L2 bridging, oracles) where a call on L2 re-enters L1 logic with unexpected state.                                                                   |
