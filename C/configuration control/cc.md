üõ†Ô∏è Term: Configuration Control ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context (Reinforced)
Configuration Control ensures that changes to protocol-critical parameters or components are made in a secure, auditable, and authorized manner. In Web3, this includes managing:

Role permissions

Protocol fees and thresholds

Plugin/module contracts

Governance settings

Bridge/oracle addresses

Upgrade paths

Improper control leads to protocol compromise, economic abuse, or governance capture.

üìò 1. Types of Configuration Control in Web3
Type	Description
Role-Gated Config Control	Only specific roles (e.g. CONFIG_ADMIN) can modify settings
Timelock-Enforced Control	Changes require N blocks delay before execution
DAO Proposal Control	Config changes routed through DAO voting and quorum thresholds
Version-Locked Control	Only specific versions/modules are allowed in certain roles
Immutable Control	Certain parameters become permanent post-deployment or audit

üí• 2. Configuration Control Failures ‚Üí Attack Vectors
Attack Scenario	Description
Unauthorized Fee Escalation	Attacker changes feePercent = 100%, blocking user withdrawals
Backdoor Plugin Injection	Malicious plugin added to Safe, DAO, or bridge without controls
Role Drift / Privilege Creep	Misconfigured role can update core settings after governance bypass
Fast-Track Governance Coup	Flashloan voter passes config change with 0 delay and low quorum
ZK or Oracle Endpoint Swap	Verifier address rerouted to attacker-controlled system

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Configuration Control Defenses
Strategy	Solidity Implementation
‚úÖ AccessControl / BitGuard	Explicit permission slots for each config category
‚úÖ Timelock Controller	Delay execution of all config updates
‚úÖ Config Change Logs	Emit ConfigChanged, ConfigApproved for all changes
‚úÖ Freeze Functionality	Lock parameters after finalization phase (via configLocked = true)
‚úÖ Config Drift Detection	Validate live state against a stored baseline hash

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationControlCenter.sol
This implementation:

Uses RBAC + timelocks + logging

Protects dynamic config keys

Supports drift audit against committed baseline hash
