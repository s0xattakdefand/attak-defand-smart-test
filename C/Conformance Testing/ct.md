🧪 Term: Conformance Testing — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Conformance Testing is the process of verifying that a smart contract or Web3 system adheres to a defined standard, specification, or protocol interface. It ensures compatibility, correctness, and predictability across implementations and across chains.

In Web3, conformance testing validates:

ERC standards (ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-4626, etc.)

Governance interfaces (Governor Bravo, Compound)

Bridge or ZK proof verification formats

On-chain/off-chain API compliance

Behavior under fuzz or state simulation

📘 1. Types of Conformance Testing in Web3
Type	Description
ERC Standard Conformance	Checks if contract matches standard behavior (e.g., transfer, approve)
Modular Interface Conformance	Ensures plug-ins or modules implement required hooks/interfaces
Cross-Chain Format Validation	Validates that proofs, payloads, or messages match target chain specs
ZK Circuit Input Compliance	Checks format of public inputs/output against zkVerifier or aggregator
Governance Protocol Conformance	Confirms DAO adheres to voting, quorum, and execution timing specs

💥 2. Attack Vectors from Non-Conformance
Attack Type	Description
ERC-20 Inconsistency	transfer() doesn’t return a bool → causes failures in aggregators
Storage Layout Drift	Proxy upgrade fails because new logic doesn’t conform to expected layout
Bridge Replay Risk	Message from foreign chain doesn’t match the expected encoding format
ZK Verifier Rejection	Circuit sends wrong public input → proof fails silently
Hook Execution Failure	Plugin doesn’t implement expected callback → system breakage

🛡️ 3. Conformance Testing Best Practices
Practice	Solidity / Framework Strategy
✅ Standard Interface Test Suites	Use OpenZeppelin’s test coverage for ERC standards
✅ Interface ID Verification	Use type(IModule).interfaceId == contract.supportsInterface(...)
✅ Storage Layout Snapshotting	Capture and verify storage alignment across upgrades
✅ Boundary and Fuzz Testing	Use Foundry/Hardhat fuzz tests for edge-case behavior
✅ SimStrategyAI Compliance Fuzz	Simulates malformed messages, payloads, or upgrades

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ERC20ConformanceTester.sol
This contract:

Validates minimal ERC-20 behavior

Emits results for conformance analysis

Detects function reverts or silent failures
