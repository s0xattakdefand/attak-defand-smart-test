🧠 Term: Consequence-Driven Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Consequence-Driven Cyber-Informed Engineering (CCE) is a proactive cybersecurity methodology that focuses on identifying, modeling, and engineering systems to withstand their most damaging cyber-physical consequences. Originally designed for critical infrastructure (e.g., energy, utilities), in Web3, CCE adapts to:

🛡️ Model worst-case smart contract failures,
🔥 Simulate protocol collapse from targeted exploits,
🏗️ Engineer resilience into contracts, bridges, DAOs, and DeFi vaults,
🔁 Focus not just on likelihood — but impact severity if compromise occurs.

📘 1. CCE Phases Adapted for Web3 Systems
Phase	Web3 Interpretation
1. Consequence Prioritization	Identify the most devastating protocol failure (e.g., DAO drain, bridge spoof)
2. System-of-Systems Analysis	Map interdependent contracts (e.g., proxy, vault, plugin, relay)
3. Attack Surface Reduction	Remove or disable non-essential functions/roles
4. Consequence-Based Engineering	Redesign components to isolate and mitigate worst-case impacts

💥 2. Consequence-Focused Web3 Attack Scenarios
Consequence Target	Attack Example
Bridge Funds Drained	2-of-3 guardian collusion or spoofed relay
DAO Treasury Hijack	Quorum abuse or proposal drift leads to mass token transfer
ZK Rollup Replay Attack	Old proof reused across domains → false finality
Proxy Upgrade Bricks Logic	Storage layout mismatch → full protocol lockout
Validator Poisoning	Slashed via forced misbehavior through relay manipulation

🛡️ 3. Web3 Countermeasures Aligned with CCE
Countermeasure Type	Implementation
✅ Blast Radius Isolation	Vaults or bridges with hard caps + time-based rate limits
✅ One-Time Role Escalation Review	Disable DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE post-deployment
✅ Cross-System Kill Switch	Emergency pause from guardian quorum or ThreatUplink.sol
✅ Proof-of-Impact Simulation	Use SimStrategyAI to model and test maximum consequence paths
✅ Immutable Guardrails	finalize() config or lock keys using ImmutableConfig.sol

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConsequenceResilienceGuard.sol
This contract:

Limits the impact of critical actions

Enforces max withdrawal, pausable fail-safe, and admin lock

Built for CCE-aligned defense
