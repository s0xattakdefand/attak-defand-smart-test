🛡️ Term: Computer Network Defense (CND) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Network Defense (CND) refers to protecting and maintaining the integrity, availability, and confidentiality of computer networks. In Web3, CND is adapted to decentralized systems by defending against:

RPC overloads, validator compromise, bridge hijacks, governance coups, oracle abuse, DoS attacks, and smart contract manipulation — using on-chain guards, pause mechanisms, rate limits, and detection systems.

📘 1. Types of CND in Web3
Type	Description
Perimeter Defense	Rate limits and RPC filters to block high-frequency external abuse
Contract-Level Defense	nonReentrant, role-based access control, invariant checks
Bridge & Oracle CND	Nullifier enforcement, replay guards, multi-oracle confirmation
Governance Defense	Proposal review gates, timelocks, voting stake requirements
Cross-Domain Defense	Protects against L1↔L2 spoofed messages or replayed proofs
Forensic CND	Detects entropy drift, gas anomalies, and abnormal execution flows

💥 2. Attacks CND Must Prevent or Mitigate
Attack Vector	Description
Governance Takeover (Flashloan)	Proposal passed via borrowed tokens/quorum abuse
Bridge Replay Attack	Cross-chain message reused to claim tokens twice
Gas Grief Loop	Reentrant call floods gas limits and DoSes other users
Calldata Bombing / Mempool Spam	Fills block with junk to delay legitimate txs
Oracle Drift / Feed Lag	Exploits price updates by timing manipulation
Storage Corruption	Proxy upgrade introduces misaligned storage or unclean state transition

🛡️ 3. Computer Network Defense Strategies for Web3
CND Strategy	Implementation
✅ Emergency Pause Systems	Allow DAO or CERT to pause critical modules during exploit
✅ Rate-Limited Callers	Restrict function frequency via block.timestamp or tx.origin memory
✅ Replay/Drift Guards	Use unique message IDs or Merkle roots to validate state transition
✅ Proposal Filter Layers	Require simulation success or quorum bonding to submit governance props
✅ SimStrategyAI CND Mode	Simulates edge-case payloads to trigger and test defense flows
✅ Trusted Role Enforcement	Only allow validated contracts or whitelisted addresses for key ops

✅ 4. Solidity Code: NetworkDefenseGuard.sol
