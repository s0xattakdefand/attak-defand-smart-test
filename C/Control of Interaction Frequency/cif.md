### üîê Term: **Control of Interaction Frequency**

---

### 1. **What is Control of Interaction Frequency in Web3?**

**Control of Interaction Frequency** refers to mechanisms that **limit how often** an address, role, or module can **interact with a smart contract** or perform specific operations ‚Äî to **prevent abuse**, **spam**, or **timing-based exploits** like frontrunning, flash bots, or reentrancy loops.

> üí° It's like implementing **rate limits, cooldowns, or session windows** in smart contracts to **throttle behavior** and maintain system integrity.

### 2. **Types of Interaction Frequency Controls**

| Type                             | Description                                                           |
| -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Per-Address Cooldown**         | Each address must wait a set duration before re-invoking a function.  |
| **Global Rate Limit**            | Limits how often the function can be executed network-wide.           |
| **Role-Based Frequency Control** | Some roles can bypass or have looser restrictions.                    |
| **Windowed Action Control**      | Function only available during specific time windows or block ranges. |
| **Session-Based Access**         | Interaction allowed within a session ID or signed proof expiry.       |

---

### 3. **Attack Types Prevented by Interaction Frequency Control**

| Attack Type                | Prevention Mechanism                                              |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spam Transactions**      | Per-address cooldown prevents contract flooding.                  |
| **MEV Frontrunning**       | Windowed or randomized delays reduce predictability.              |
| **Flash Loan Drain Loops** | Global rate limits block back-to-back calls in the same block.    |
| **Repeated Oracle Pulls**  | Per-address limit or time window restricts redundant fetches.     |
| **Voting/Claim Spam**      | Cooldowns stop duplicate vote/claim abuse in a governance system. |

| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `enforceGlobalCooldown()` | Ensures that only 1 call can be made globally per N minutes. |
| `enforceUserCooldown()`   | Each user can only interact every N minutes.                 |
| `getTimeLeft()`           | UI integration or simulation check for cooldown window.      |
| `setCooldowns()`          | Dynamically tunable via DAO or owner logic.                  |

| **Bridge withdrawals**             | One withdrawal per user every 10 blocks.          |
| **Minting NFTs**                   | Throttle per-user mint rate to prevent gas wars.  |

### üß† Summary

**Control of Interaction Frequency** in Web3:

* ‚úÖ Prevents spam, drain, MEV bots, and timing abuse
* ‚úÖ Applies to **users**, **roles**, or **entire systems**
* ‚úÖ Enhances **stability, fairness**, and **auditability**
* ‚úÖ Best used with time-based modifiers, randomness, or off-chain enforcement bots

---

üì¶ Combine with:

* `block.timestamp` or `block.number`‚Äìbased windows
* EIP-712 signed session permits
* DAO voting to adjust thresholds dynamically
* Multi-chain replay guard to enforce frequency across L2s
