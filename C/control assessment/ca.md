### 🔐 Term: **Control Assessment**

---

### 1. **Types of Control Assessment in Web3 / Smart Contracts**

A **Control Assessment** in Web3 is the process of **evaluating the effectiveness, scope, and integrity** of security and operational controls within a decentralized system — particularly **access control**, **state management**, **upgrade paths**, and **execution safety**. It helps identify **gaps** in protection mechanisms and ensures **roles, privileges, and critical functions** are adequately enforced.

| Control Assessment Type                | Description                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control Assessment**          | Evaluates if ownership, roles, and permission levels are strictly enforced.             |
| **Execution Flow Assessment**          | Checks whether function calls are guarded by appropriate status or role modifiers.      |
| **Upgrade & Proxy Control Assessment** | Audits whether upgradeability is restricted and storage layouts are safe.               |
| **State Control Assessment**           | Verifies that contract state changes only occur under proper controls.                  |
| **Emergency Control Assessment**       | Validates pause/unpause logic and ability to disable critical functions during attacks. |

### 2. **Attack Types Exposed by Failed Control Assessments**

| Attack Type               | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Privilege Escalation**  | Unauthorized roles can access or modify admin functions.            |
| **Uncontrolled Upgrades** | Logic or storage upgradeable by anyone or without verification.     |
| **Bypass of Modifiers**   | Functions can be called even when the contract is paused or frozen. |
| **Role Drift**            | Roles can be granted/revoked improperly, weakening access controls. |
| **Logic Exposure**        | Emergency or sensitive logic enabled in the wrong contract state.   |

### 3. **Defense Mechanisms Validated by Control Assessment**

| Defense Type                         | Description                                                          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Enforces per-function role validation.                               |
| **Pausable + Status Guards**         | Ensures critical functions respect emergency modes.                  |
| **Ownership Transfer Restrictions**  | Prevents unauthorized takeovers.                                     |
| **Proxy Admin Separation**           | Ensures upgrades are gated and secured via dedicated admin contract. |
| **Event Logging for Changes**        | Tracks changes to control structures for audit.                      |

### ✅ What to Assess

| Control Element | Assessment Questions                                  |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `onlyOwner`     | Is ownership enforced and non-transferable by others? |
| `grantAdmin`    | Can only the owner assign admin privileges?           |
| `grantOperator` | Can only admin assign operator roles?                 |
| `whenNotPaused` | Do sensitive functions respect paused state?          |
| `event logs`    | Are changes traceable via events?                     |

### 🧠 Summary

A **Control Assessment** validates:

* ✅ Who controls what (roles, ownership)
* ✅ When they can act (status, paused state)
* ✅ How changes are logged and secured

This is critical for:

* Governance systems
* Upgradeable proxies
* DAO treasury contracts
* Vaults and trading strategies
