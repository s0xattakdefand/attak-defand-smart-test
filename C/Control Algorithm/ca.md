🛡️ Term: Continuous Threat Detection (CTD) — Web3 / Smart Contract Runtime Security Context
Continuous Threat Detection (CTD) is the real-time process of identifying, flagging, and responding to anomalies or attack patterns as they occur during smart contract execution, network interaction, or off-chain communication. In Web3, CTD enables proactive protection by:

🧠 Monitoring live function calls, gas usage, entropy, role access
🧪 Detecting replay, spoofing, flashloan abuse, or fallback drift
🔁 Reacting to high-risk activity via alerting or automated mitigation
📡 Feeding security telemetry into dashboards or AI defense agents (e.g., SimStrategyAI)

📘 1. Types of Continuous Threat Detection in Web3
CTD Type	Description
Onchain Behavior Monitoring	Smart contracts log and flag anomalous call patterns
Offchain Event Stream Analysis	Indexer or security agent processes logs in real-time
Selector Entropy Drift Detection	Detect function call mutations, fallback spam, or replays
Gas Spike Detection	Flags gas grief attacks, infinite loops, or DoS vectors
Address Pattern Analysis	Observes repeating call patterns or bot-like addresses

💥 2. Attack Vectors Without Continuous Threat Detection
Attack Type	Risk Description
Fallback Drift & Selector Abuse	Undocumented functions are called via fallback()
Reentrancy + Flashloan Loops	Without CTD, repeated calls blend into normal behavior
Spoofed MetaTx/Relayer Activity	Malicious relayers send forged calldata without detection
Upgradability Backdoor Activation	Logic contract changed silently without alert
Gas & Storage DoS	Loop or spam overwhelms contract without real-time detection

🛡️ 3. Best Practices for Continuous Threat Detection in Web3
Strategy	Web3 Implementation
✅ Real-Time Log Emission	Emit ThreatDetected(...) and Anomaly(...) from critical functions
✅ Selector Entropy Scoring	Track drift in function selectors or fallback calls
✅ Gas/Entropy Threshold Watch	Define baseline gas/entropy and flag spikes
✅ Time-to-Reentry (TTR) Tracking	Detect rapid or recursive caller patterns
✅ Telemetry Uplink Integration	Send anomalies to ThreatUplink or AI dashboard

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ContinuousThreatDetector.sol
This smart contract:

Monitors call selectors and gas

Flags anomalies based on thresholds

Can integrate with ThreatUplink
