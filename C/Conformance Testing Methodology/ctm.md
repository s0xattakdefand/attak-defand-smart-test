üß™ Term: Conformance Testing Methodology ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Conformance Testing Methodology defines the structured approach used to verify whether a smart contract or Web3 system conforms to specified standards, interface expectations, upgrade rules, or cross-chain format compliance.

This methodology ensures contracts behave predictably, securely, and compatibly within the broader ecosystem ‚Äî such as ERC standards, DAO protocols, proxy patterns, zk formats, and interop modules.

üìò 1. Types of Conformance Testing Methodologies
Methodology Type	Description
Standards-Based Testing	Validate against formal ERCs (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721, ERC-4626)
Interface Conformance	Check interface IDs (supportsInterface) or required method existence
Behavioral Conformance	Simulate real use cases (e.g., transfer, vote, pause, propose)
Upgrade Safety Testing	Verify storage layout and logic match post-upgrade
Cross-Domain Format Testing	Ensure message/payload format matches target bridge/oracle/zk spec

üí• 2. Attack Risks from Poor Conformance Testing
Issue Type	Exploit Risk
ERC-20/721 Deviation	Tokens fail on transfer or approval ‚Üí breaks DeFi apps
Missing Interface Methods	Plugins/hooks/modules silently fail on expected callback
Storage Layout Drift	Proxy upgrade causes slot overlap or breaks initialization
Cross-Chain Format Mismatch	Bridge or rollup relays invalid payloads or proofs
Silent Failure	Non-standard return types or revert suppression hides errors

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Web3 Conformance Testing Methodology (Phases)
Phase	Activities
‚úÖ Specification Review	Identify target spec (ERC-20, Governor, LSP7, IBC, etc.)
‚úÖ Static Interface Matching	Check ABI signatures, supportsInterface, layout expectations
‚úÖ Dynamic Test Suite Execution	Run standard scenarios (e.g., transfer, approve, vote)
‚úÖ Fuzz + Mutation Testing	Apply random and boundary input tests via Foundry/Hardhat
‚úÖ Post-Upgrade Revalidation	Ensure storage slots, interfaces, and logic match after upgrades
‚úÖ Cross-Chain Simulation	Replay calldata and proof encoding on forked chains or domains
