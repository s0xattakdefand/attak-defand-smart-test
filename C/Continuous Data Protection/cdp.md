🔄 Term: Continuous Data Protection (CDP) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security & Storage Integrity Context
Continuous Data Protection (CDP) is a strategy that backs up or snapshots data in real-time or near-real-time, ensuring any modification is captured for instant recovery, auditability, and tamper detection. In Web3, CDP applies to:

💾 Off-chain storage linked to onchain hashes (e.g., oracles, DAOs, zk metadata)
📜 DAO governance records, proposal metadata, execution logs
🧠 zkProver inputs or circuit configurations
⚙️ Rollup/bridge state history
📡 Oracle updates or feed submissions

📘 1. Types of Continuous Data Protection in Web3
Type	Description
Immutable Data Snapshotting	IPFS/Filecoin/Arweave timestamped storage of key state
Onchain Hash Commit Logs	Hash of every off-chain data update committed onchain for audit
Versioned zkInput Registry	CDP tracks zkProof inputs over time to detect drift or fraud
Bridge / Relayer State Checkpoints	Periodic commits of relayer or bridge state
Proposal / Vote Archival	DAO content archived per block with rollbacks possible

💥 2. Attack Surfaces Without CDP in Web3
Risk Type	Description
Data Drift	Off-chain data (e.g., oracles, zkInputs) silently changes after hash commit
Replay with Old State	Lack of snapshot allows attacker to reuse old proposal/input
Lack of Forensic Trail	Governance attack cannot be investigated without point-in-time records
Proof Mismatch	zkProof based on altered, uncommitted input
Bridge Message Disputes	Message origin not traceable without timestamped data

🛡️ 3. Best Practices for CDP in Web3 Systems
Strategy	Implementation
✅ Snapshot and Hash Every Update	Off-chain: IPFS/Arweave/Filecoin + hash → Onchain: store hash+block
✅ Immutable Content Addressing	Use CID v1/IPFS with timestamp → prevent overwrites
✅ Hash Chains or Merkle Proofs	Link updates in tamper-evident structure (e.g., Merkle audit trail)
✅ Zero-Knowledge Update Witnessing	ZK proof verifies snapshot existed at specific time
✅ Access Logs and Trigger Hooks	Record who/what/when updated data state

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CDPSnapshotRegistry.sol
