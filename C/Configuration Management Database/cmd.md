🧠 Term: Configuration Management Database (CMDB) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Configuration Management Database (CMDB) is a central repository that stores and manages configuration items (CIs) and their relationships across a system. In Web3, a CMDB tracks on-chain contracts, modules, parameters, oracles, governance roles, and their versioned state to enable:

✅ Auditability,
✅ Change control,
✅ Security posture validation,
✅ Dependency and impact analysis.

In decentralized systems, a **CMDB becomes the foundation for tracking contract deployments, upgrades, config changes, and their interdependencies.

📘 1. Types of CMDB Models in Web3
CMDB Type	Description
On-Chain Registry-Based CMDB	Smart contract that logs and manages CIs and their relationships
Versioned Contract CMDB	Tracks deployed contract addresses, versions, implementation hashes
Governance CMDB	Maps DAO roles, voting thresholds, plugin relationships
Oracle/Bridge CMDB	Manages trusted endpoint config and relayer-verifier mappings
Security Baseline CMDB	Tracks replay guards, pausers, access roles, and upgrade paths

💥 2. Attacks from Missing or Tampered CMDB
Failure Scenario	Risk Introduced
Orphaned CI (Dangling Access)	Untracked contract retains privileged access
Outdated Verifier in zk System	Incorrect SNARK verifier leads to false proofs accepted
Contract Drift	Deployment mismatches expected config → storage collision or behavior dev
Plugin Injection / Drift	Unknown or unauthorized modules loaded into Safe or DAO
No Rollback Visibility	Cannot verify previous config state for remediation

🛡️ 3. Defenses via CMDB Implementation
Strategy	Solidity or System Design Pattern
✅ CI & Relationship Registry	Store all components and how they link (parent, child, dependency)
✅ Hash & Version Mapping	Track code and config by keccak256 hash and timestamp
✅ Audit Trail for Updates	Emit events and store past states
✅ Role & Plugin Binding Maps	Track which actor/module has access to what
✅ SimStrategyAI Impact Modeling	Simulate change on one CI and predict cascade impact

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationManagementDB.sol
This contract:

Tracks registered configuration items

Links relationships

Stores historical snapshots for rollback and audit
