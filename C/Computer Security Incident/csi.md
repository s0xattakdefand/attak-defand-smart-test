🚨 Term: Computer Security Incident — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Computer Security Incident is any unauthorized, suspicious, or malicious event that affects the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of a computer system or network. In Web3, a security incident may involve:

Smart contract exploits, DAO proposal manipulation, bridge compromise, key leakage, or on-chain/off-chain service disruptions, all of which require detection, logging, containment, and response.

📘 1. Types of Computer Security Incidents in Web3
Incident Type	Description
Smart Contract Exploit	Reentrancy, integer overflow, logic flaw, fallback misuse
Bridge Replay or Message Hijack	Cross-chain message reused or redirected
DAO Governance Coup	Flashloan-based vote hijack, malicious proposal passes
Oracle Price Manipulation	Feed delay or manipulation causes mispriced trades or loans
Key Compromise	Private key leak from frontends, compromised signers or delegates
Protocol Downtime (DoS)	Event spam, infinite loop, sequencer halt, or RPC overload

💥 2. Attacks Leading to Security Incidents
Attack Vector	Security Impact
Reentrancy Loop	Drains vaults or LPs via fallback abuse
Flashloan Governance Attack	Takes control of treasury or settings temporarily
Message Replay (Bridge/Router)	Re-executes an already used withdrawal or call
Gas Bombing / Fallback Loop	Causes DoS by consuming gas or blocking execution
Upgrade Hijack	Admin updates logic to malicious contract
Zero-Day Fallbacks	Attackers find exploitable selector or ABI that bypasses checks

🛡️ 3. Defenses and Responses to Security Incidents
Defense / Response	Implementation
✅ Incident Logging & Alerts	Use emit logs for events like access failure, threshold triggers
✅ Pause Guards & Circuit Breakers	Immediately halt sensitive operations during an incident
✅ CERT Integration	Link with a Web3 CERT (Web3CERTResponder.sol) to coordinate response
✅ Replay Protection + Nullifiers	Prevent repeated execution of same message/proof
✅ Governance Rollback Conditions	Allow DAO-controlled incident-based undo of proposals
✅ SimStrategyAI Incident Replays	Simulate variants of the incident to prepare future defenses

✅ 4. Solidity Code: SecurityIncidentLogger.sol
This contract:

Logs potential and confirmed incidents

Triggers mitigation like pauses

Supports admin review and follow-up
