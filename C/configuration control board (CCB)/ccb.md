🧭 Term: Configuration Control Board (CCB) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Configuration Control Board (CCB) is a governance entity that reviews, approves, and manages configuration changes to systems in a controlled, auditable manner. In Web3, a CCB becomes a DAO-like or multisig committee that:

🛡️ Ensures only authorized, vetted config changes are applied to critical contracts
📑 Logs all requests, decisions, and approvals
⛓️ Can veto, delay, or freeze updates to system parameters, plugins, or modules

📘 1. Types of CCB Structures in Web3
CCB Structure Type	Description
Multisig-Based CCB	Config updates require approval from N-of-M signers
DAO Voting CCB	Config change proposals go through quorum, delay, and vote
Hybrid CCB	Off-chain council reviews → on-chain timelock + multisig
Automated CCB	SimStrategyAI + security oracles approve config drift corrections
Cert-Linked CCB	Integrated with CERTResponder to block unsafe config proposals

💥 2. CCB-Relevant Attack Scenarios
Attack Type	Without CCB Oversight	Impact
Backdoor Config Injection	Attacker pushes malicious plugin as fee handler	Protocol funds rerouted
Zero-Delay Parameter Flip	Fees changed to 100%, quorum lowered to 0	DoS or governance hijack
Ghost Admin Reactivation	Orphaned config admin regains access silently	Bypasses all controls
Storage Drift Config Mismatch	Config updated while storage layout drifts	Upgrade bricked or exploitable

🛡️ 3. Defenses via a Web3 CCB
Strategy	Solidity Enforcement Tool
✅ Proposal Queuing + Delay	TimelockController or custom ConfigChangeQueue.sol
✅ Role-Restricted Voting	Only designated CCB members may vote on critical updates
✅ Event-Based Transparency	Every request/approval/rejection is logged
✅ Config Hash Snapshotting	Verify post-update config matches reviewed proposal
✅ SimStrategyAI Integration	Test and score proposed changes before execution

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CCBConfigGovernor.sol
This contract:

Lets CCB members vote on config change proposals

Tracks quorum, delay, and decision outcome

Enforces that only approved changes are applied
