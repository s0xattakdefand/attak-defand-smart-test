üß© Term: Configuration Item (CI) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Configuration Item (CI) is any individually identifiable component of a system whose configuration state must be tracked, versioned, controlled, and auditable. In Web3, CIs are critical parts of a protocol stack ‚Äî especially in systems where security, governance, and upgrades rely on trusted configuration.

A CI in Web3 can be a contract address, oracle route, ZK verifier, DAO setting, fee structure, plugin module, or storage variable ‚Äî anything that, if altered, may affect the behavior, security, or correctness of the system.

üìò 1. Types of Configuration Items in Web3
CI Type	Description
Contract Address	Deployed logic or proxy address tied to protocol behavior
Module or Plugin	External execution logic registered (e.g. Zodiac, Uniswap hook, Safe module)
Governance Parameter	Quorum %, delay windows, proposal thresholds, etc.
Oracle or Bridge Route	Address or ID of relayer or data source
Security Module	Replay guard, pause controller, role manager
ZK Verifier or Prover	Circuit parameters, SNARK/STARK verifier contracts
Storage Key or Constant	Token limits, fees, access thresholds stored in the contract

üí• 2. Attack Vectors via CI Mismanagement
Attack Vector	Misconfigured CI Example
Rogue Plugin Injection	Malicious plugin added as a Safe executor or DAO module
Oracle Reroute	CI points to attacker-controlled oracle, feeding false prices
Storage Collision CI Drift	Upgraded logic uses same slot differently, breaking system logic
Fee Escalation	CI sets withdrawal fee to 100%
Role Drift	CI assigns admin role to unintended actor

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Secure Configuration Item Management Strategies
Defense Strategy	Implementation Method
‚úÖ CI Registry + Audit Log	Register and track each CI with audit events
‚úÖ Hash Snapshot of All CIs	Hash all CIs into a single config hash (baseline)
‚úÖ Immutable or Finalizable CIs	Prevent changes to critical items after deployment or final audit
‚úÖ Proposal-Gated Updates	Route CI changes through DAO, timelock, or multisig
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI CI Drift Check	Fuzz CIs and test system behavior on simulated drift scenarios

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationItemRegistry.sol
