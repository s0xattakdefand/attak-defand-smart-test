⚙️ Term: Configuration Control — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Configuration Control refers to the management and governance of changes to system parameters, settings, and modular components. In Web3, configuration control ensures that only authorized actors can modify critical smart contract parameters, and that all changes are auditable, secure, and fail-safe.

In decentralized systems, poor configuration control can lead to catastrophic failures — such as fee changes to 100%, oracle reroutes, or governance hijacks.

📘 1. Types of Configuration Control in Web3
Type	Description
Role-Based Control	Only authorized roles can update parameters
Governance-Gated Control	All changes must pass DAO proposals or multisig votes
Time-Delayed Control	Configuration changes are queued and only executed after a delay
Immutable Control	Certain parameters become unchangeable after deployment or audit
Versioned Control	Uses upgradeable proxies or version tags with strict tracking

💥 2. Attack Scenarios from Lack of Configuration Control
Attack Type	Risk Description
Unrestricted Parameter Editing	Malicious actor sets fees, limits, or access without restrictions
Config Front-Running	Attacker submits config update faster due to lack of timelock
Abandoned Admin Keys	Privileged roles left active after transfer → exploitable indefinitely
Backdoor Config Module	Introduced config hook bypasses governance or role control
Governance Override Attack	Proposal passed with quorum abuse to change security-critical settings

🛡️ 3. Defense Strategies for Configuration Control
Strategy	Solidity Implementation Practice
✅ AccessControl/BitGuard	Limit config setters using RBAC or bitmask permissions
✅ ConfigChange Delay (Timelock)	Queue config updates for N blocks before execution
✅ Immutable Flags	Permanently disable changes after final config is approved
✅ Event Logging + Audit Hooks	Emit logs and integrate with external audit trails (ThreatUplink)
✅ SimStrategyAI Fuzz Tests	Test edge-case config updates with fuzzed parameters

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationControlManager.sol
This contract:

Registers configuration change requests

Applies role checks and optional timelocks

Emits logs and maintains active config values
