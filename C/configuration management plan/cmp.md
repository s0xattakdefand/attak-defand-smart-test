🗂️ Term: Configuration Management Plan (CMP) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Configuration Management Plan (CMP) is a formalized document or system that defines how configuration items (CIs) are identified, controlled, reviewed, updated, and audited. In Web3, a CMP ensures that smart contracts, governance settings, modules, and security parameters:

Are registered and versioned

Can only be updated through approved workflows

Include rollback, baseline, and audit mechanisms

Are simulated and validated before deployment

It’s the strategic governance layer ensuring config integrity, traceability, and resilience in decentralized systems.

📘 1. Components of a Web3 Configuration Management Plan
CMP Component	Description
CI Identification	Define and list all tracked config items (contracts, fees, plugins, etc.)
Change Control Workflow	Set of rules for proposing, reviewing, approving, and executing changes
Versioning Policy	Define how versions are labeled and rolled forward/back
Approval Authority	Multisig, DAO, or CCB that must approve high-risk CI updates
Baseline & Drift Detection	Reference config state hash + comparison mechanism for future states
Audit & Notification Hooks	Log config events and optionally notify off-chain systems (ThreatUplink)

💥 2. Attack Scenarios Without a CMP
No CMP Element Present	Risk Introduced
❌ No CI Registry	Plugins, oracles, or roles added/modified without audit trail
❌ No Approval Workflow	Any role or actor may change configs, including critical parameters
❌ No Baseline Hashing	Drifted contracts go unnoticed (proxy upgrades or relayer swaps)
❌ No Change Delay	Config changes happen immediately — exploitable in governance/fee logic
❌ No Simulation Layer	Unvetted logic breaks storage layout or enables attack routes

🛡️ 3. CMP Enforcement Strategies in Web3
Defense Strategy	Solidity Practice or Module
✅ Configuration Registry (CMDB)	Register and describe all tracked config items with metadata
✅ Change Proposal Queue	ConfigChangeQueue.sol or DAO proposals with delay
✅ Role/DAO Gating	onlyRole(CONFIG_ADMIN) or DAO multisig gating
✅ Baseline Snapshot Validator	keccak256 hash of all current CI values; verify before change
✅ SimStrategyAI Dry-Run	Fuzz and simulate proposed config updates before live execution

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationManagementPlan.sol
This contract:

Registers and approves tracked config items

Applies a queued workflow

Checks baseline hashes

Logs all changes for auditability
