üß± Term: Computer Security Object ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Computer Security Object is any digital resource or asset whose access, modification, or interaction must be controlled. In Web3, this maps directly to on-chain entities like:

Smart contracts, roles, storage slots, tokens, keys, proposals, bridges, and identities that require access control, validation, logging, and protection.

üìò 1. Types of Security Objects in Web3
Object Type	Description
Smart Contract Instance	Logic object deployed at an address with protected callable functions
Storage Slot / State Variable	Critical state such as balances, roles, ownership
Role / Permission Object	Mappings that define access (e.g., isAdmin, AccessControl)
Token Object (ERC-20/721)	Transferable object with ownership, approval, and metadata
DAO Proposal Object	Structured governance action, stored and executed via proposal calls
Bridge Message Object	Message ID, payload hash, or proof used in cross-chain communication
ZK Commitment Object	Commitment, nullifier, or Merkle leaf hash used in ZK circuits

üí• 2. Attacks Targeting Security Objects
Attack Type	Target Object	Description
Reentrancy Attack	Balance/state object	Reentrant call modifies state before previous completes
Role Escalation	Access control object	Malicious change to admin or minter role
Token Transfer Hijack	Token ownership object	Replay or exploit to transfer ownership illegitimately
Storage Drift Attack	State variable / proxy slot object	Upgrade modifies object location or type
Cross-Domain Spoofing	Bridge message object	Reused message or spoofed proof allows replay
DAO Proposal Injection	Proposal object	Hidden malicious actions packed into proposal structure

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses for Security Objects
Defense Strategy	Implementation Example
‚úÖ Strict Access Control	Use onlyRole, AccessControl, or BitGuard to restrict usage
‚úÖ Role Revocation Logs	Emit RoleRevoked events to track permission changes
‚úÖ Storage Slot Locking	Use fixed slot IDs or storage verification pre/post-upgrade
‚úÖ Object Hash Commitments	Hash object state and validate integrity (e.g., bytes32 hashObject)
‚úÖ ZK Nullifier/Object Guard	Ensure objects like commitments and nullifiers are not reused
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Object Fuzzing	Test mutated objects and replay against logic for defense coverage

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: SecurityObjectGuard.sol
This contract:

Tracks critical security objects (roles, balances, commitments)

Validates object state

Logs object creation and mutation

Supports object revocation and access control
