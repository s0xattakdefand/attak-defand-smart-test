üõ°Ô∏è Term: Computer Security Division (CSD) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
The Computer Security Division (CSD), such as that within NIST, is responsible for researching, developing, and advising on security standards, practices, and controls for protecting computing systems.

In Web3, a Computer Security Division maps to a modular, on-chain/off-chain security governance system that oversees:

Secure smart contract design

Threat detection & response

Standards enforcement

Risk scoring and classification

Review and mitigation of protocol changes

It functions as a composable security layer, often integrated with CERTs, DAO councils, and simulation systems.

üìò 1. Types of Security Divisions in Web3
Type	Description
On-Chain Security Governance	Smart contracts that enforce or verify security policies
Audit & Risk Review Systems	Store audit hashes, assign risk ratings to contracts
CERT-Oriented Divisions	Incident response logic, subsystem alerts, and mitigation dispatch
ZK / Privacy Division	Reviews cryptographic privacy and constraint correctness
Upgrade Policy Division	Screens all contract upgrade proposals before execution
Simulation-Based Review	Uses tools like SimStrategyAI to simulate contract behavior and risks

üí• 2. Attacks Addressed by a CSD
Attack Type	CSD Mitigation Role
Contract Upgrade Backdoor	Review bytecode diff and block unsafe upgrades
Replay / Relay Attack	Enforce nullifiers and replay-resistant encoding
DAO Proposal Injection	Screen for malicious proposal payloads
Role Escalation / Privilege Drift	Monitor unexpected role grants or plugin loads
Zero-Day Selector Drift	Detect unusual calldata selectors and warn via entropy logs

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defense Functions of a CSD in Web3
Function	On-Chain or Off-Chain Implementation
‚úÖ Security Module Registry	Stores & manages approved security modules (pausers, replay guards, etc.)
‚úÖ Audit Hash Validation	Verifies proposals or upgrades against IPFS/SHA-based audit references
‚úÖ Risk Tier Classification	Assigns and enforces risk tier limits to contracts
‚úÖ CERT Escalation Logic	Routes high-risk activity to a CERT or Security Council
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Integration	Simulates pre-deployment fuzz cases for drift, exploits, and fallbacks

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: SecurityDivisionRegistry.sol
This contract:

Manages registered security modules

Stores audit hashes & risk tiers

Interfaces with CERTs or proposal filters
