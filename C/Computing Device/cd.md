üíª Term: Computing Device ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Computing Device refers to any hardware or software system capable of processing data or executing code. In Web3, a computing device includes both on-chain execution units and off-chain agents that interact with decentralized protocols.

In this context, a computing device can be:

Smart contracts (EVM)

Wallet signers

Nodes and relayers

Oracles

zkProvers

MEV bots

DAO plugin runners

üìò 1. Types of Computing Devices in Web3
Type	Description
On-Chain Smart Contract	Deployed contract executing logic via EVM or WASM
Wallet Device	Hardware/software signer (Ledger, MetaMask, WalletConnect)
Validator Node	Computes consensus or block validation (PoS, DPoS)
Oracle Node	Computes off-chain data ‚Üí pushes on-chain proofs
zkProver	Device (or service) that computes and proves zkSNARKs or STARKs
Bridge Relayer	Relays messages across chains (L1‚ÜîL2) using signatures or proofs
SimStrategyAI Agent	Off-chain simulation device to compute threat/response patterns

üí• 2. Attacks on Computing Devices in Web3
Attack Type	Target Device	Description
Private Key Extraction	Wallet device	Malware or phishing to steal signing credentials
Proof Spoof / Relay Forgery	Bridge relayer	Signs fake message or proof replay
Oracle Feed Manipulation	Oracle device	Submits malicious or delayed price data
zkProver Output Drift	zk device	Malicious prover crafts incorrect but valid-looking proof
Node Reorg Attack	Validator node	Fork manipulation or vote bribery to create false block sequences
Bot Behavior Injection	Simulation device	MEV bot feeds manipulated market data into DeFi pool

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses for Web3 Computing Devices
Defense Strategy	Description
‚úÖ Hardware Wallets	Keeps private keys off insecure systems
‚úÖ Multisig / MPC Signatures	Threshold signing to prevent single point of failure
‚úÖ Bridge Replay Guards	Enforce message ID uniqueness + timestamp windows
‚úÖ Oracle Aggregation Thresholds	Require N-of-M agreement to publish feed
‚úÖ zkProof Verifiers	Enforce hash commitments + constraint satisfaction on-chain
‚úÖ Device Auth Logs	Track signer, relay, oracle ID by device origin

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: DeviceAccessRegistry.sol
This contract:

Registers trusted devices (relayers, provers, oracles, bots)

Logs usage

Allows blocking or revoking compromised devices
