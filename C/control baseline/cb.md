### 🔐 Term: **Control Baseline**

---

### 1. **What is a Control Baseline in Web3?**

A **Control Baseline** is a predefined **set of minimum access, status, and security controls** that **must exist** in every smart contract or decentralized system component. In Web3, control baselines ensure **standardized protections** across modules, reducing the attack surface and improving security governance.

It is **similar to NIST SP 800-53 baselines** in traditional systems, but adapted for:

* On-chain role management
* Upgrade safety
* Function gating
* Emergency recovery
* Logging & auditability

### 2. **Types of Control Baseline in Web3 / Smart Contracts**

| Baseline Type                   | Description                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control Baseline**     | All sensitive functions must be restricted via `onlyOwner`, `onlyRole`, or `AccessControl`. |
| **Status Enforcement Baseline** | Pausable/activatable status must gate fund movement or sensitive ops.                       |
| **Upgrade Safety Baseline**     | Upgradeable contracts must use UUPS or Transparent Proxy with upgrade guards.               |
| **Event Logging Baseline**      | All critical actions (admin, fund, status) must emit events for auditability.               |
| **Emergency Control Baseline**  | Must include pause mechanism and restricted self-destruct logic (if any).                   |

### 3. **Attack Types Prevented by Control Baselines**

| Attack Type               | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Open Access**           | No modifiers or role checks — any address can call critical functions.  |
| **Reentrancy or Replay**  | No `whenNotPaused()` or circuit breaker logic in place.                 |
| **Unrestricted Upgrades** | Logic can be changed by any caller due to missing proxy admin controls. |
| **Silent Exploits**       | No events make actions invisible to monitoring systems.                 |
| **Emergency Inaction**    | System lacks ability to halt function in response to exploits.          |

    function _authorizeUpgrade(address newImplementation) internal override onlyOwner {}

```

### ✅ What This Baseline Ensures

| Component             | Baseline                                       |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Control**    | `onlyOwner`, `onlyOperator` modifiers in place |
| **Status Guard**      | `whenNotPaused` applied to core logic          |
| **Upgrade Safety**    | `_authorizeUpgrade()` protected by `onlyOwner` |
| **Audit Logging**     | All changes emit events (add/remove/execute)   |
| **Emergency Control** | Owner can pause/unpause at any time            |

---

### 🧠 Summary

A **Control Baseline** guarantees:

* ✅ **Standard security controls** exist across smart contracts
* ✅ Protocols can **pass audits and verifications** efficiently
* ✅ DAOs and L2s maintain **resilient upgrade, pause, and access structures**

🧩 Combine with:

* `AccessControl` for complex RBAC
* `RoleRegistry` for DAO-voted permissions
* `StatusRouter` for coordinated protocol mode switching
* `AuditHooks` to stream all control actions to monitoring dashboards
