📜 Term: Consensus Audit Guidelines — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Consensus Audit Guidelines refer to the framework, processes, and technical controls used to review, validate, and secure the consensus layer or consensus-sensitive logic in blockchain systems and smart contracts.

In Web3, these guidelines are critical for:

L1 and L2 consensus mechanisms (PoW, PoS, BFT, zkRollup finality)

Bridges, sequencers, oracles, and cross-chain relays

Any contract logic that depends on global agreement or finalized state

📘 1. Types of Consensus Audits in Web3
Audit Type	Description
L1 Consensus Layer Audit	Review block finality, validator rotation, fork rules (e.g., Ethereum PoS)
L2 Sequencer/Prover Audit	Check fraud/zkevm proof validity, reorg resistance, and dispute handling
Bridge Consensus Audit	Review relayer quorum rules, signer sets, retry/replay logic
Oracle Consensus Audit	Validate off-chain aggregator rounds, deviation thresholds, signer quorum
Contract Consensus Logic	Confirm that smart contracts don’t diverge state based on non-finalized data

💥 2. Attack Vectors Without Proper Consensus Audits
Vulnerability	Risk Description
Relayer Collusion	2-of-3 bridge relayers forge proof or bypass validation
Sequencer Censorship	Single sequencer filters or reorders messages
Finality Drift in ZK Rollup	Proof accepted from unfinalized L1 block → possible replay or invalidation
Oracle Desync	OCR round mismatch causes price drift or manipulation
Cross-Chain Replay	Same message executed on both forked chains

🛡️ 3. Consensus Audit Guidelines (Security Practices)
Guideline	Implementation Strategy
✅ Signer Set Registry	Track active signer set with delay and version history
✅ Quorum Enforcement On-Chain	Require minimum M-of-N for bridge/oracle message to execute
✅ Replay Guard by BlockHash/Nonce	Tie messages to finalized block hash or chain-specific epoch
✅ ZK/Fraud Proof Delay Periods	Allow challenge window before finalization
✅ SimStrategyAI Fork Replay Testing	Simulate consensus drift and replay across fork scenarios

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConsensusValidator.sol
This contract:

Stores trusted signers

Enforces quorum rules

Rejects messages from non-finalized forks

Prevents message replay
