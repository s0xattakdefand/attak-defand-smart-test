📘 Term: Concept of Operations (CONOPS) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Concept of Operations (CONOPS) is a high-level description of how a system is intended to function from the perspective of users, operators, and stakeholders. In Web3, a CONOPS helps define:

🧠 What the system does,
🧑‍💼 Who operates or interacts with it,
🛠️ How it is deployed and evolves,
🔐 And how it handles security, upgrades, governance, failure, and recovery.

It is essential for ensuring alignment between system design and operational behavior, especially for decentralized protocols, bridges, DAOs, and rollups.

📘 1. Types of CONOPS in Web3 Systems
CONOPS Type	Description
Governance CONOPS	Defines proposal flow, quorum, execution, veto paths
Security CONOPS	Describes how incidents are detected, responded to, and logged
Upgrade CONOPS	Outlines proxy or module upgrade flow, role separation, delay logic
Bridge CONOPS	Covers message passing, verification, relayer roles, and failover
Rollup/zk CONOPS	Describes prover/sequencer interaction, dispute, and settlement paths
Vault/DeFi CONOPS	Specifies flow for deposits, withdrawals, yield, slashing, and fees

💥 2. Attack Vectors from Misaligned or Missing CONOPS
Misalignment	Risk Introduced
No Pause or Kill Path	Cannot respond to exploitation quickly
Upgrade Flow Not Separated	Attacker or dev can deploy logic + push upgrade instantly
Governance Front-Run Risk	Lack of proposal queue leads to race conditions
Bridge Failover Missing	Stuck or replayed messages due to broken relay
Role Escalation Path Hidden	Undocumented admin backdoor bypasses CONOPS intent

🛡️ 3. Operational Controls for CONOPS Enforcement
Strategy	Solidity Mechanism or Pattern
✅ Role Separation	Use AccessControl or BitGuard to isolate operational responsibilities
✅ Time-Locked Changes	Upgrade or config changes go through TimelockController
✅ Pause + Emergency Routes	Include Pausable and EscapeHatch modules
✅ Audit Hooks	Emit OperationStarted/Ended events for off-chain tracking
✅ SimStrategyAI CONOPS Drill	Simulate attack/failure to validate expected operational flow

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConceptOfOperationsController.sol
This contract:

Encodes operational actions like pause, upgrade trigger, and audit emitters

Uses role separation and emit logs to enforce expected CONOPS behavior
