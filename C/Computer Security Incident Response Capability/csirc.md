üõ†Ô∏è Term: Computer Security Incident Response Capability (CSIRC) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Security Incident Response Capability (CSIRC) refers to an organization‚Äôs ability to detect, respond to, contain, and recover from computer security incidents. In Web3, CSIRC is implemented as a modular on-chain/off-chain incident response system capable of:

Monitoring smart contract and protocol activity, detecting anomalies or exploits, automatically mitigating threats (e.g. pausing contracts or blocking addresses), and supporting CERT- or DAO-driven response playbooks.

üìò 1. Types of CSIRC Modules in Web3
CSIRC Component	Description
Incident Detection Engine	Monitors logs, gas, entropy, calldata patterns for attack signatures
On-Chain Response Controller	Executes actions like pausing, freezing, or role revocation
CERT Integration Layer	Allows CERT members to escalate or mitigate incidents
Replay & Recovery Engine	Simulates and reverses incident impact
Incident Reporting System	Logs attack metadata with severity, actor, and response
ZK-Aware Proof Guard	Validates messages and mitigates spoofed zkProofs or replayed calldata

üí• 2. Attacks That CSIRC Must Handle
Attack Scenario	CSIRC Response
Reentrancy Exploit	Auto-pause affected contracts, flag attacker address
Bridge Replay / Proof Drift	Block reused message IDs, record evidence for forensic tracing
Governance Proposal Attack	Block execution, revoke delegate, quarantine treasury
Oracle Manipulation	Trigger emergency price override or threshold guard
Fallback Abuse / Gas Bomb	Cut off call chains by blocking reentrancy or mutating input
Key/Role Compromise	Rotate keys, disable compromised modules, or restrict call routes

üõ°Ô∏è 3. CSIRC Response Mechanisms
Response Type	Example Implementation
‚úÖ Emergency Pause	Triggered automatically or by CERT multisig
‚úÖ Address Blacklisting	Block known attacker or compromised accounts
‚úÖ Nullifier / Message Replay Guard	Prevent cross-chain message reuse or spoofing
‚úÖ CERT Role-Gated Access	Response actions require CERT multisig authorization
‚úÖ Recovery Simulation	Replays incident in fork to predict impact and plan mitigation
‚úÖ Threat Alert Broadcasting	Push logs to ThreatUplink.sol for off-chain CERT and community review

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: CSIRCResponseController.sol
This contract:

Logs incident metadata

Provides on-chain response controls

Verifies CERT member authority

Supports auto-pause, blacklist, and recovery hooks
