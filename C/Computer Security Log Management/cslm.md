üßæ Term: Computer Security Log Management ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Security Log Management refers to the collection, storage, analysis, and monitoring of logs to detect and respond to security-related activities. In Web3, this translates to on-chain and off-chain event logs, calldata patterns, execution traces, and anomaly logs, used to:

Monitor for exploits, detect protocol abuse, track attacker behaviors, and maintain an immutable forensic trail across smart contracts, bridges, DAOs, and relayers.

üìò 1. Types of Security Logs in Web3
Log Type	Description
Transaction Logs	Logs of calls, gas usage, caller addresses, function selectors
Event Logs (emit)	On-chain emitted logs from contract functions
Execution Trace Logs	Low-level opcode call/return/memory traces (off-chain or simulated)
Replay & Drift Logs	Logs of repeated calldata or entropy changes over time
Role & Access Logs	Track role assignment, use, and permission changes
Governance & Vote Logs	Proposal submission, execution, delegate movement
Cross-Chain Message Logs	Logs for bridge relays, proof IDs, L1 ‚Üî L2 message fingerprints

üí• 2. Attacks Revealed by Log Monitoring
Attack Type	Log Evidence
Reentrancy Exploit	Repeated fallback entries in the same tx trace
Replay Attack	Same calldata or proof hash reused across multiple blocks/chains
Backdoor Execution	Unusual selector or role bypass usage with no prior record
Governance Coup	Rapid delegate shifts before malicious proposal execution
Zero-Day Call Drift	Unused function selectors suddenly triggered by attacker
Gas Grief / DoS Loop	Excessive gas consumption or looping logs from a single actor

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Log Management Defenses and Best Practices
Strategy	Implementation
‚úÖ Immutable Event Logging	Use emit logs with indexed fields for searchable on-chain records
‚úÖ Per-Selector Logging	Log each selector hit and count per caller
‚úÖ Drift & Replay Detection	Hash and store calldata/fingerprint history
‚úÖ Off-Chain Aggregation Hooks	Send logs to ThreatUplink.sol or external SIEM tools
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Log Simulation	Replay logs to simulate attack progression and behavioral drift
‚úÖ Severity-Based Logging	Tag logs by severity: info, anomaly, critical
