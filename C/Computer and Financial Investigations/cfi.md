🧾 Term: Computer and Financial Investigations — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer and Financial Investigations involve the forensic tracing, auditing, and attribution of suspicious or criminal activities involving digital systems and financial assets.

In Web3, this translates to the on-chain investigation of smart contract exploits, wallet behaviors, and financial flows, including:

Hacks, rug pulls, bribe trails

Flash loan attack analysis

Bridge replays

Mixer exit trails

Governance manipulation

📘 1. Types of Computer and Financial Investigations in Web3
Type	Description
On-Chain Forensics	Trace addresses, transaction flows, token movements
Smart Contract Forensics	Analyze bytecode, storage states, and logs for malicious behavior
Governance Manipulation Audit	Track voting behavior, delegate shifts, proposal origins
Flash Loan Analysis	Dissect multi-call attack vectors and contract interactions
Anonymity Doxxing	De-anonymize users based on gas, timing, or call patterns
Cross-Chain Transfer Audit	Follow bridge trails, liquidity moves, and rewrapped token flows

💥 2. Attacks That Trigger Investigations
Exploit Category	Example Case
Rug Pulls	Token dev drains LP, disables transfers
Oracle Manipulation	Flash loan alters TWAP for fake profit
Governance Coup	Flash-vote manipulation of DAO treasury
Bridge Replay	Message reuse or proof replay to double-withdraw assets
Gas Griefing Loops	Loops emit events or reverts to obscure traceability
Contract Self-Destruct	Malicious code deletes storage/log trail instantly

🛡️ 3. Defenses & Investigation Tools
Strategy	Description
✅ Transaction Graph Indexers	Build DAGs of contract interactions (e.g., Tenderly, EigenPhi, Arkham)
✅ On-Chain Provenance Logs	Use emit events to trace state/authorship
✅ Replay Guard + Message ID	Prevent cross-chain proof replays
✅ zkAudit Hooks	Proof-based financial trails with privacy-preserving aggregation
✅ SimStrategyAI Forensic Mode	Auto-fuzzes known attacks and traces their trails
✅ Risk-Based Alerting	Watch suspicious addresses with entropy/gas/log deviation

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ForensicAuditTrail.sol
This contract:

Emits structured financial audit logs

Tracks suspicious events

Supports manual investigation flags

Optionally freezes suspect funds
