🔐 Term: Contingency Key — Web3 / Smart Contract Security & Key Management Context
A Contingency Key is a backup cryptographic key (or key role) provisioned in a system to take over or recover control during emergency or failure conditions, such as:

🔥 Primary key compromise
🧱 Multisig stuck state
🛠 Protocol upgrade failure
🧪 Bridge freeze or ZK circuit halt
🛡 Governance failure or deadlock

In Web3, contingency keys are essential for operational resilience, especially in high-value systems like DAOs, oracles, bridges, rollups, and DeFi vaults.

📘 1. Types of Contingency Keys in Web3
Type	Description
Emergency Admin Key	Used to pause or migrate system under critical threat
Timelocked Contingency Key	Can only activate after delay to ensure transparency
Multisig Escrow Key	Used only when main multisig is unreachable or fails
ZK Recovery Key	Trusted key to issue recovery proofs if sequencer/prover fails
Contingency Role Key	Role-based key that is only activated in fallback functions (e.g., RECOVERY_ROLE)

💥 2. Attack Vectors Involving Contingency Keys
Risk Type	Description
Key Misuse or Activation Abuse	Contingency key used outside of emergencies
No Key Rotation / Expiry	Old contingency keys stay valid forever → risk if leaked or outdated
Bypass of Governance	Contingency key used to override DAO decision with no public logging
Backdoor Scenario	Hidden contingency key intentionally left for covert control
No Throttling or Delay	Instant execution without detection or resistance

🛡️ 3. Best Practices for Secure Contingency Key Management
Strategy	Implementation
✅ Timelock Activation	Delay any contingency action (e.g., 48–72h) before it takes effect
✅ Public Logging & Governance Oversight	Emit events, allow community to veto or monitor fallback calls
✅ Key Rotation and Expiry	Replace or deactivate old contingency keys regularly
✅ Minimized Permission Scope	Contingency key should have access to only emergency functions
✅ MultiSig or Role-Based Wrap	Require multiple actors to confirm contingency actions

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ContingencyKeyManager.sol
This smart contract:

Registers a backup key with time-delayed activation

Controls access via CONTINGENCY_ROLE

Emits clear logs for traceability
