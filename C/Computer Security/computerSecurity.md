üñ•Ô∏è Term: Computer Security ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Security refers to the protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, data breaches, damage, or disruption. In the Web3 context, computer security extends to both on-chain (smart contracts, wallets) and off-chain (nodes, frontends, relayers, infrastructure) components of decentralized systems.

In Web3, computer security is the foundational umbrella covering all aspects of smart contract integrity, network defense, key management, and data privacy.

üìò 1. Types of Computer Security in Web3
Type	Description
Network Security	Protect RPCs, nodes, and P2P layers from DDoS, spoofing, or eclipse attacks
Application Security	Secure smart contracts, dApps, APIs, frontends
Endpoint Security	Protect wallets, signers, browser extensions
Data Security	Ensure confidentiality and integrity of stored and transmitted data
Identity and Access Control	Role-based access, DAO permissions, key custody
Incident Response & Recovery	Systems that monitor, detect, and mitigate attacks

üí• 2. Attacks Targeting Computer Security in Web3
Attack Vector	Description
Private Key Theft	Malicious code or phishing extracts EOA or hardware wallet key
Smart Contract Exploits	Bugs like reentrancy, overflow, logic flaws
Node/Infra Exploits	RPC impersonation, node takeover, replay of messages
Governance Takeovers	Attackers hijack DAO votes or quorum
Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)	Fake dApp or node intercepts data or signs malicious txs
Side-Channel Leaks	Attackers infer data via gas, timing, proof size, opcode patterns
Supply Chain Attacks	Inject malicious logic via packages, upgradable modules, or plugins

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses for Computer Security in Web3
Strategy	Implementation
‚úÖ Multisig + Role-Based Access	Require multiple signers and strict RBAC in contracts
‚úÖ Audit + Formal Verification	Run Slither, MythX, and formal tools like Certora or Z3
‚úÖ Timelocks and Upgrade Guards	Delay high-impact actions, enforce upgradeability via Safe or DAO vote
‚úÖ ZK or MPC Key Custody	Replace EOAs with zkLogin, MPC wallets, or hardware wallets
‚úÖ Runtime Assertion Checks	Use assert, require, and invariant testing with Foundry
‚úÖ Secure RPC + TLS Pinning	Protect API/gateway endpoints from injection and MitM
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Testing	Continuously evolve fuzz payloads and test contract behavior

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: ComputerSecurityGuard.sol
This contract demonstrates:

Role-based access control

Upgrade logic lockdown

Emergency pause

Basic invariant guard for state tracking
