🧭 Term: Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer-Aided Dispatch (CAD) refers to the automated coordination of resources in response to incidents or requests. Traditionally used in emergency services, in Web3, this concept maps to:

A modular, smart contract-based dispatch system that dynamically assigns security actions, validators, relayers, or response modules in reaction to detected on-chain incidents or threats — enabling automated incident response, CERT activation, or governance rollbacks.

📘 1. Types of Computer-Aided Dispatch in Web3
CAD Type	Description
CERT Incident Dispatcher	Automatically triggers CERT responders/contracts based on threat patterns
Relayer Routing Dispatcher	Chooses optimal bridge relayer or zkVerifier for cross-chain proofs
Governance Response Dispatcher	Activates predefined actions (pause, veto, migrate) for critical proposals
Bot Coordination Dispatcher	Assigns simulation or mitigation roles to MEV/security bots
ZK Proof Dispatcher	Chooses which prover or circuit to dispatch based on input class

💥 2. Threats Requiring Automated Dispatch
Threat Type	CAD Response Strategy
Smart Contract Exploit	Dispatch pause() function + log incident + notify CERT
Bridge Replay / Drift	Dispatch bridge proof guard + update message ID tracking
Governance Proposal Attack	Auto-dispatch rollback module + delegate revocation
Oracle Spoofing	Switch to fallback oracle + broadcast anomaly
Sequencer Downtime	Trigger L2 fallback route or alternate relayer dispatch

🛡️ 3. Web3 CAD Defense Capabilities
Strategy	Implementation Method
✅ Rule-Based Dispatch Triggers	Based on calldata, gas, or entropy signals
✅ CERT Hook Integration	Routes incidents to Web3CERTResponder with category and severity
✅ Modular Response Contracts	Dispatches action to modular contracts like PauseGuard, RollbackRouter
✅ Dispatch Queuing & Throttling	Avoids overload by batching or limiting per block
✅ SimStrategyAI Threat Router	Learns best dispatch route from past incident simulations

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CADDispatcher.sol
This contract:

Accepts incident reports or event-based triggers

Dispatches appropriate actions to responder modules

Tracks dispatch history and prevents duplicate execution
