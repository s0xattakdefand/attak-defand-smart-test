🧑‍💻 Term: Computer Forensics — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Forensics is the discipline of identifying, preserving, analyzing, and presenting digital evidence. In Web3, computer forensics adapts to decentralized systems and focuses on:

Tracing smart contract interactions, wallet behaviors, and state transitions to uncover malicious activity, protocol abuse, or fund theft, while preserving chain-of-custody on immutable ledgers.

📘 1. Types of Computer Forensics in Web3
Type	Description
On-Chain Transaction Forensics	Tracing interactions, fund flows, call stacks, gas signatures
Smart Contract Forensics	Analyzing deployed bytecode, storage state, logs, and modifiers
Wallet Attribution & Clustering	Identifying attacker wallets based on usage, timing, and entropy
Cross-Chain Exploit Tracing	Following malicious behavior across bridges and L2s
Temporal Forensics	Block-by-block timeline reconstruction of exploits or anomalies
Log/Event-Based Forensics	Parsing emit logs to reconstruct execution flows

💥 2. Attacks Requiring Forensic Analysis
Attack Type	Forensic Need
Flash Loan Exploits	Trace nested calls and transient asset manipulation
Reentrancy	Reconstruct call depth and fallback entry points
Rug Pulls	Detect creator-controlled withdrawals and transfer events
Zero-Day Backdoors	Reverse-engineer bytecode and trace unused logic paths
Governance Coups	Log delegate changes, vote timing, quorum manipulation
Bridge Replay Attacks	Track duplicated withdrawal proofs across domains

🛡️ 3. Defenses Supported by Forensics
Defense Technique	Forensics Contribution
✅ Postmortem Analysis	Enables patching after incident and report generation
✅ Attack Replay & Simulation	Used to verify reproduction and simulate attack propagation
✅ Event Hash Auditing	Matches logs to reference behaviors to catch suspicious executions
✅ Anomaly Detection Training	Historical forensic data trains AI tools like SimStrategyAI
✅ Governance Rollback Trigger	If forensic evidence proves abuse, DAO can revert proposals
✅ Evidence Preservation	Log-based trails serve as immutable legal/audit-grade proof

✅ 4. Solidity Code: OnChainForensicsLogger.sol
This contract:

Emits forensic-grade logs on every interaction

Optionally flags abnormal behavior

Records gas, call origin, and selector signatures
