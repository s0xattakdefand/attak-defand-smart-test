üõ†Ô∏è Term: Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
A Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) is a specialized group responsible for detecting, analyzing, responding to, and mitigating security incidents. In the Web3 ecosystem, a Web3 CERT focuses on:

Rapid detection and response to smart contract exploits, DAO takeovers, oracle manipulation, bridge attacks, and on/off-chain anomalies ‚Äî with tools for pause, revoke, restore, and alert.

üìò 1. Types of CERT Functions in Web3
Type	Description
Exploit Response Team	Detects and mitigates active smart contract attacks
Bridge or Oracle Incident Unit	Monitors and validates critical cross-chain messaging and feeds
Governance CERT	Handles malicious proposal detection and mitigation
Security Alert Dispatcher	Broadcasts CERT-level incidents via on-chain/off-chain channels
Forensic Investigation CERT	Traces attacker flows, performs root-cause analysis
Recovery CERT	Enacts fallback logic, admin key rotation, or DAO-controlled rollbacks

üí• 2. Attacks Requiring CERT Activation
Attack Vector	Trigger for CERT Response
Smart Contract Exploit	Reentrancy, overflow, logic flaw, backdoor
Bridge Replay / Proof Drift	Cross-chain withdrawal duplication
Oracle Price Attack	Manipulation of feed or delay in updates
Governance Takeover Attempt	Flash-loan based voting or delegate coup
Flash Loan Market Manipulation	Sudden TVL shift via multi-protocol exploit
ZK Verifier Bypass	Acceptance of invalid proof ‚Üí state corruption

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses & CERT Capabilities
CERT Capability	Web3 Implementation
‚úÖ Emergency Pause Hooks	Integrated pause across contracts with CERTPauseGuard.sol
‚úÖ Exploit Detection Logging	Real-time exploit signals sent to ThreatUplink.sol or Discord/Webhooks
‚úÖ Recovery Escalation	Key rotation, vault migration, plugin disable
‚úÖ Governance Interlock	Require CERT multisig confirmation for emergency proposal veto
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI CERT Mode	Auto-replays potential attack paths + alerts on drift
‚úÖ Threat Map Broadcast	CERT logs exploit and mitigations to public or private audit networks
