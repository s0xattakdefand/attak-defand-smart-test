🧠 Term: Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Monitoring Context
Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) is a proactive security framework focused on continuous monitoring, vulnerability detection, and real-time defense. In Web3, CDM is essential to:

📡 Monitor live smart contract behaviors and system drift
🧪 Detect new vulnerabilities, entropy shifts, selector mutations
🛡 Mitigate active threats (reentrancy, replay, gas spikes, logic drift)
🔁 Automate patching, pausing, or rate-limiting in high-risk environments

CDM shifts Web3 security from “audit once” to real-time, adaptive defense.

📘 1. Types of CDM in Web3 Environments
CDM Type	Description
Onchain Diagnostic Agents	Smart contracts that observe, log, or validate other contracts in real time
Telemetry Feeds & Threat Logs	Stream function calls, gas usage, entropy, replay attempts to off-chain
Automated Mitigation Modules	Trigger pause/lock/rollback actions based on metrics or events
Selector Drift Detection	Detect mutated or anomalous function selectors (e.g., fallback abuse)
Upgrade & Storage Auditors	Watch for proxy upgrades, slot overwrites, or contract collisions

💥 2. Attack Vectors Without CDM
Attack Type	Description
Undetected Logic Drift	Selector or logic mutated without triggering alarm
Silent Governance Takeover	Malicious proposals submitted & executed without audit trace
Replay Exploits	Reused calldata or signed data replays due to lack of nonce/context check
Gas Griefing / DoS	Contract spammed, gas maxed out, or revert looped without mitigation
Malicious Upgrade Activation	Proxy points to new logic contract with embedded backdoor

🛡️ 3. Best Practices for Continuous Diagnostics & Mitigation
Strategy	Web3 Implementation
✅ Threat Logging & Streaming	Push logs to ThreatUplink with context (function, gas, caller, entropy)
✅ Real-Time Anomaly Detection	Use entropy, MOE, gas drift to detect abnormal usage
✅ Auto-Mitigation Modules	Trigger pause() or role lockout based on thresholds
✅ Upgradeable Contract Auditors	Monitor and validate logic address changes in proxies
✅ Replay/NFT Mint/Proposal Watchers	Detect high-frequency or duplicate attempts

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CDMMonitor.sol
This smart contract:

Monitors and logs function call entropy, gas usage, and origin

Can trigger emergency pause if thresholds are exceeded
