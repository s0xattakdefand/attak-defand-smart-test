üß® Term: Computer Abuse ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Abuse refers to the malicious or unauthorized use of computer systems, often violating legal, ethical, or protocol rules. In Web3, computer abuse includes both on-chain and off-chain misuse of smart contracts, wallets, APIs, and decentralized infrastructure.

In the Web3 context, computer abuse encompasses everything from wallet phishing and botnet-based MEV attacks to contract overuse, governance manipulation, and RPC flooding.

üìò 1. Types of Computer Abuse in Web3
Type	Description
Contract Overuse Abuse	Repeated or excessive contract calls to cause DoS or griefing
Automated Exploitation	Use of bots or scripts to exploit flash loans, reentrancy, MEV, etc.
Gas Griefing / Abuse Loops	Abuse of gas or fallback mechanics to drain block space
Unauthorized Access	Abuse of improperly gated roles or storage
Data Injection / Pollution	Uploading malicious or misleading data on-chain (e.g., fake prices, URIs)
Off-Chain API / RPC Abuse	Bots spamming APIs, bridges, oracles, RPC endpoints
Sybil Attack Abuse	Abuse of identity assumptions to bypass limits (airdrops, voting)

üí• 2. Attacks Based on Computer Abuse
Attack Vector	Description
Reentrancy Loop Bomb	Trigger abuse loop via fallback or recursive call
Event Flooding	Emit excessive events to inflate logs or waste resources
Oracle Feed Abuse	Spam low-value tokens to manipulate feed or liquidity curves
Governance Spam	Submit junk proposals to block real governance
Storage Bloat Attack	Write large structs repeatedly to inflate storage and gas cost
Sybil Validator Flood	Launch thousands of fake validators/nodes to sway consensus or spam

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses Against Computer Abuse
Defense Strategy	Implementation Method
‚úÖ Rate Limiting	Per-user rate enforcement (lastCall[msg.sender])
‚úÖ Access Control (RBAC)	Gate all sensitive functions behind roles, whitelists, or zkAuth
‚úÖ Gas Cost Thresholds	Reject transactions with excessive resource use
‚úÖ Storage Quota Enforcement	Limit number of writes/updates per user or epoch
‚úÖ Proposal Filtering	Reject spam governance submissions via stake, quorum, or content check
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Abuse Tracker	Run abuse simulations with entropy/gas/log tracking
