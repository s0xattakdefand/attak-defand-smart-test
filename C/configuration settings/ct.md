⚙️ Term: Configuration Settings — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Configuration Settings refer to all on-chain adjustable parameters that control the behavior of a smart contract or protocol. In Web3, these settings directly affect governance, risk, economics, and security — and misconfigured settings are a top vector for exploits and downtime.

These settings can be:

Fees, rates, thresholds

Access roles or whitelists

Plugin/module addresses

Quorum %, voting durations

Bridge relayers or zkVerifier roots

📘 1. Types of Configuration Settings in Web3
Setting Type	Description
Economic Settings	Fee percent, interest rates, yield strategy toggles
Security Settings	Role mappings, pauser flags, replay protection thresholds
Governance Settings	Quorum %, delay, voting duration, max active proposals
Protocol Limits	Withdraw cap, stake cap, slippage tolerance
External Interfaces	Oracle address, bridge relayer, verifier logic address
ZK or L2 Settings	Proof limits, nullifier tree depth, zk root expiration windows

💥 2. Attack Vectors via Misconfigured Settings
Attack Vector	Vulnerable Configuration Setting
Fee Denial-of-Service	feePercent = 10000 (100%) blocks all user withdrawals
Role Override	admin mistakenly reassigned to attacker address
Oracle Spoofing	Oracle config points to attacker-controlled contract
Bridge Hijack	Verifier setting changed without audit → accepts fake messages
Slippage Abuse	Slippage config set to 100% → price manipulation possible
ZK Circuit Mismatch	Incorrect nullifier or root history length allows proof replay

🛡️ 3. Defense Mechanisms for Configuration Settings
Strategy	Solidity or Protocol Pattern
✅ Access Control / Role Gating	onlyRole(CONFIG_ADMIN) for any setting update
✅ Timelock or DAO Approval	Delay or vote-based application of sensitive setting changes
✅ Emit Setting Change Logs	Event logging: ConfigChanged(string key, old, new)
✅ Immutable Finalization	Disable setting updates post-audit using configLocked = true
✅ Drift Detection	Compare live settings against keccak256 baseline hash

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConfigurationSettingsManager.sol
This contract:

Stores key protocol settings

Protects them with role control

Emits logs and supports baseline comparison
