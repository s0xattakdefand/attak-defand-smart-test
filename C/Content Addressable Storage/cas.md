📦 Term: Content Addressable Storage (CAS) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security & Infrastructure Context
Content Addressable Storage (CAS) is a storage model where data is retrieved by its content hash (e.g., SHA-256) instead of its location or path. This model underpins decentralized file systems and immutable, verifiable data access in Web3.

In Web3, CAS is used for:

🔐 Verifying data integrity in IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin, Swarm

📄 Storing smart contract metadata (e.g., ABI, source, frontend)

🧠 Linking zkProofs, NFTs, or governance proposals to immutable content

🌉 Ensuring cross-chain data availability through proof-of-storage systems

📘 1. Types of Content Addressable Storage in Web3
CAS System	Description
IPFS (InterPlanetary FS)	Uses CID (Content Identifier) derived from data hash
Arweave	Permanent CAS with economic incentives for archival storage
Filecoin	CAS with verifiable storage proofs and market-driven capacity
Swarm (Ethereum)	Ethereum-native CAS with incentive layer
Onchain CAS Hashes	Hashes stored in smart contracts, pointing to external content

💥 2. Attack Surfaces with Improper CAS Integration
Attack Type	Risk Description
Hash Substitution	Attacker provides wrong data with same format but different content
Poisoned Content	Public IPFS hash points to malware or scam file
Replay of Old Content	Contract accepts outdated but valid content hash
No Pinning or Proof	Data exists at publish but disappears later → breaks oracle/proof flows
Encoding Ambiguity	Same content with different encodings creates inconsistent hashes

🛡️ 3. Security Practices for CAS in Smart Contracts
Strategy	Implementation Pattern
✅ Store Expected Hash Onchain	Store keccak256 or IPFS CID in contract to verify against input
✅ Require Content Proof	Off-chain service must prove CID presence (e.g., Filecoin storage proof)
✅ Pin/Archive Critical CIDs	Use pinning service (e.g., Pinata, Web3.Storage) for liveness guarantees
✅ Use CID v1 + DAG-PB or RAW	Ensure consistent encoding and deterministic CID
✅ Content TTL or Expiry Check	Add timestamp to validate freshness of submitted CAS reference

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CASValidator.sol
This smart contract:

Stores known content hashes (e.g., IPFS or Arweave)

Validates incoming content by comparing hashes
