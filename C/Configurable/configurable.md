‚öôÔ∏è Term: Configurable ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Configurable refers to any parameter, module, or behavior in a system that can be modified at runtime or deployment. In Web3 and smart contract security, configurability must be tightly controlled, audited, and safeguarded ‚Äî as it can open attack surfaces if improperly exposed.

A configurable contract allows dynamic management of fees, limits, roles, plugins, or external addresses ‚Äî but must balance flexibility with immutability, access control, and upgrade safety.

üìò 1. Types of Configurable Elements in Web3
Configurable Element	Description
Fees / Rates / Thresholds	Protocol fees, DAO quorum %, price slippage guards
Role Permissions	Dynamic granting/revocation of operator/admin roles
Plugin / Module Addresses	Replaceable logic components (e.g., Safe plugins, Uniswap hooks)
Governance Settings	Time-lock delays, voting windows, quorum, proposal limits
Bridge / Oracle Routes	Change source relayers, endpoint addresses
ZK Circuit Parameters	Nullifier size, proof limits, root history windows

üí• 2. Attack Vectors on Configurable Systems
Attack Type	Risk Description
Unauthorized Parameter Change	Malicious actor changes withdrawal limit, fee %, or vault cap
Plugin Drift Injection	New plugin/module changes behavior unexpectedly
Upgrade Escalation	Admin changes config to allow unrestricted upgrades
Governance Backdoor	Configurable voting power or quorum thresholds altered post-deploy
Router Override	Relayer or oracle config pointed to attacker-controlled endpoint

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses for Secure Configurable Contracts
Defense Strategy	Solidity Pattern or Practice
‚úÖ Role-Based Access Control	Use onlyRole, AccessControl, or BitGuard for config setters
‚úÖ Emit Config Change Logs	Transparently log every change (event ConfigChanged(...))
‚úÖ Freeze Critical Configs	Make parameters immutable post-deployment if they never need changing
‚úÖ Audit + Hash Snapshot	Register expected config hashes to validate at runtime
‚úÖ DAO Proposal Gate	Route certain config updates through DAO vote or time-lock delay
