📋 Term: Conformity Assessment — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Conformity Assessment is the formal evaluation process used to determine whether a smart contract, module, or protocol system conforms to specified technical standards, functional requirements, and regulatory frameworks.

In Web3, conformity assessment ensures:

✅ ERC/chain/protocol compliance

✅ Security requirement satisfaction

✅ Behavioral predictability across clients, chains, or systems

✅ Auditability and deploy readiness

It combines specification matching, conformance testing, and documentation review to validate readiness for mainnet deployment or ecosystem integration.

📘 1. Types of Conformity Assessment in Web3
Type	Description
Functional Assessment	Checks if the contract behaves as per the design and use-case
Standards Assessment	Verifies ERC (e.g., ERC-20, 4626, 721), OpenGSN, or LSP conformance
Security Conformity Review	Assesses if the contract meets expected security baselines (e.g., SWC, OWASP)
Governance/DAO Compliance	Validates whether proposal flow, quorum rules, and timelocks conform
Cross-Chain Compatibility	Ensures message, proof, or payload formats match target bridge/oracle specs

💥 2. Risks When Skipping Conformity Assessment
Problem Type	Risk Introduced
❌ Non-Standard Behavior	Tokens or modules fail in ecosystem (e.g., ERC-20 transfer returns void)
❌ Upgrade Drift	Storage layout or logic breaks post-upgrade
❌ DAO Governance Abuse	Malformed proposals bypass quorum or pass instantly
❌ Cross-Chain Replay	Format mismatch allows bridge/oracle spoofing
❌ False Security Assumptions	Deployed contract lacks Pausable, ReentrancyGuard, or onlyRole controls

🛡️ 3. Conformity Assessment Procedure (Web3-Adapted)
Phase	Key Actions Performed
✅ Requirement Gathering	List all expected standards, specs, interfaces, roles
✅ Static Matching	Compare ABI, selectors, supportsInterface(), role maps
✅ Conformance Testing	Run behavioral, fuzz, and upgrade-resilience tests
✅ Security Requirement Mapping	Map functions to SWC/OWASP risk controls
✅ Cross-Chain Format Validation	Check payload/message/proof against known bridge formats
✅ Report Generation	Log pass/fail per requirement with test references and recommendations
