🔗 Term: Concept Relationship Style — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Concept Relationship Style refers to the structured way concepts are linked or composed within a system — defining how abstract security, governance, or functional concepts relate across modules, roles, chains, or actors.

In Web3, this is critical for understanding how contracts, roles, permissions, and subsystems interact, especially under composable, upgradeable, or permissionless architectures.

📘 1. Types of Concept Relationship Styles in Web3
Relationship Style	Description
Hierarchical	Top-down access or control (e.g., DAO → Treasury → Vault)
Modular / Pluggable	Concepts (RBAC, pause, replay guard) composed as independent subsystems
Event-Driven	Action follows emitted events (e.g., ProposalCreated → execution)
Cross-Domain	Concepts tied across L1↔L2, zk↔L2, oracles↔contracts
State-Mutative	One concept’s activation directly mutates another’s permissions or data
Simulated / Behavioral	Relationships evolve via fuzzed input, entropy scoring, or threat modeling

💥 2. Attack Vectors from Poor Concept Relationships
Relationship Misuse	Risk Description
Circular Privilege Escalation	One role grants another which can escalate back, forming a loop
Dangling Access Control	Orphaned module still has execution rights due to broken link
Uncoordinated Pause Logic	One contract paused, but others still active (no propagation)
Plugin Injection	New concept added without security handshake or audit
Multichain Drift	Relationship breaks across L1↔L2 due to version or timestamp mismatch

🛡️ 3. Defenses Using Concept Relationship Styles
Defense Strategy	Solidity Implementation or Pattern
✅ Modular Contract Interfaces	Separate IAccess, IPause, IAudit for clean linkage
✅ Central Relationship Registry	Stores and validates active concept links
✅ Role Delegation Audit Trail	Emits events when roles/permissions change across related concepts
✅ Simulated Execution Trees	Test evolving call/permission graphs with SimStrategyAI
✅ Fail-Safe Propagation	Pause in core module auto-pauses linked vaults or plugins

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ConceptRelationshipRegistry.sol
This contract:

Maps concept modules and their links

Verifies role-based, triggered, or fallback relationships

Supports relationship auditing and simulation replays
