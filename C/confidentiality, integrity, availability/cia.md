🔐 Term: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA Triad) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
The CIA Triad — Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability — is a foundational model in cybersecurity used to assess and design secure systems. In Web3, it forms the core of smart contract, blockchain, and protocol security.

Every secure smart contract must preserve confidentiality (data privacy), integrity (correctness and trustworthiness), and availability (accessibility and resilience) — even under decentralized, adversarial conditions.

📘 1. Types of CIA Properties in Web3
CIA Property	Web3 Interpretation & Examples
Confidentiality	Keep sensitive data hidden: zkProofs, encrypted metadata, private states
Integrity	Ensure data/code correctness: hash validation, replay guards, audits
Availability	Ensure uptime & access: gas grief resistance, pause logic, fallback paths

💥 2. Attacks on Each CIA Component
Attack Type	CIA Component Affected	Description
Metadata Exposure via calldata	Confidentiality	Sensitive token or identity data leaks via public inputs
Storage Slot Overwrite / Proxy Drift	Integrity	Upgrade corrupts contract logic or state alignment
Oracle Spoofing / Drift	Integrity	Malicious data injected into trusted feeds
Gas Grief Loop / Reentrancy	Availability	Contract execution locks or fails repeatedly
Fallback Selector Bombing	Availability	Attackers force fallback route to burn gas or cause unreachability
Replay Attack	Integrity	Same signature or message reused to rerun action

🛡️ 3. Defense Mechanisms for CIA Triad in Solidity
Defense Strategy	CIA Focus	Solidity Implementation Example
✅ ZK/Nullifier + Off-chain Secret	Confidentiality	ZK mixings, nullifier reuse prevention
✅ Storage Audit / Slot Lock	Integrity	Use fixed slot patterns or post-deployment slot verification
✅ Hash Precommit + Replay Guard	Integrity	Track used hashes and timestamps to block message reuse
✅ Pause / Circuit Breaker	Availability	Stop system in emergency to prevent cascading failure
✅ Gas Throttle & Fallback Guard	Availability	Rate-limit or block fallback routes with entropy or whitelist

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CIAGuard.sol
