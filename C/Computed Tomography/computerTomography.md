üß† Term: Computed Tomography (CT) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context (Metaphorical Interpretation)
Computed Tomography (CT) in traditional terms refers to a medical imaging technique that reconstructs layered internal views of a structure. In the Web3 and smart contract context, we interpret CT metaphorically as:

A security and logic-layer analysis model that dissects a smart contract system layer by layer to reveal hidden flaws, interactions, or logic dependencies, similar to how CT scans reveal internal issues in human anatomy.

üìò 1. Types of "Computed Tomography" in Web3 (Layered Analysis)
CT Layer (Web3 Analog)	Description
Code Layer Scan	Analyze bytecode, AST, and opcode sequences
Logic Flow Scan	Trace functional call paths and state transitions
Storage Layout Scan	Examine slot alignment, upgrade drift, proxy overlaps
Interaction Layer Scan	Track external call graphs, token approvals, delegatecall chains
Gas/Entropy Layer Scan	Detect gas anomalies, entropy patterns, drift in calldata
Cross-Module CT Scan	Track state mutations across multiple interconnected contracts

üí• 2. Attacks Revealed via CT-Like Analysis
Attack Type	Revealed via CT Layer
Storage Collision Attack	Detected through storage layout tomography
Hidden Backdoor Call	Found in interaction layer scan (unexpected external calls)
Reentrancy Timing Divergence	Shown in logic flow scan with call stack snapshots
Data Corruption from Upgrade	Seen in storage‚Üílogic layout mismatch
Proxy Drift Exploits	Upgrade logic violates original call expectations

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses Inspired by CT Model
Strategy	Implementation Tip
‚úÖ Formal Call Graph Analysis	Use Slither/Foundry/Hardhat to generate and review contract call trees
‚úÖ Storage Slot Hashing	Enforce fixed slot IDs with precomputed slot layout structs
‚úÖ Runtime Logging Hooks	Use emit/log statements for state & call introspection
‚úÖ Upgrade Simulation Fuzzing	Run CT-style fuzz tests pre-upgrade to compare slot/state impacts
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Deep Scan	Use AI-guided simulation to inspect internal interaction and gas trees
