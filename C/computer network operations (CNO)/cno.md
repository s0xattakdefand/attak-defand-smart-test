üåê Term: Computer Network Operations (CNO) ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Network Operations (CNO) traditionally refer to actions taken to monitor, defend, and potentially disrupt or exploit information systems across networks. In Web3, this maps to:

A full spectrum of on-chain and cross-chain smart contract activity, including:

CND: Computer Network Defense

CNA: Computer Network Attack

CNE: Computer Network Exploitation

CNOs in Web3 include managing smart contract deployments, responding to threats, executing coordinated simulations or attacks (red team), and deploying defensive tooling across multi-chain infrastructure.

üìò 1. Types of CNO in Web3
CNO Component	Description in Web3 Context
CND (Defense)	On-chain modules that detect, prevent, or mitigate attacks
CNA (Attack)	Coordinated simulation or deployment of exploits (replay, drift, reentry)
CNE (Exploitation)	Data exfiltration, surveillance, calldata collection, MEV mapping
Multi-Chain Ops	Orchestrating attacks/defenses across L1, L2, zk, or bridge networks
CERT Dispatch	Real-time response coordination for incident containment and analysis
SimStrategyAI CNO Mode	Automates red team/blue team scenarios across environments

üí• 2. CNO-Based Attacks and Use Cases
Attack / Operation Type	Objective
Cross-Chain Replay Attack	Abuse message reuse across L1‚ÜîL2‚Üîzk
Governance Disruption (CNA)	Spam or hijack DAO operations with malicious props
Reentrancy + Fallback Fusion	Deploy CNA and measure detection vs fallback resistance
Storage Mapping Leak (CNE)	Extract sensitive storage slot data via proxy misconfig
Gas Loop Denial (CNA)	Lock protocol using infinite gas grief loops
Attack Simulation (CNO)	Replay known CVEs or fuzz for protocol-breaking behaviors

üõ°Ô∏è 3. CNO Defense and Coordination Strategies
Strategy	Implementation Tool or Contract
‚úÖ CND Modules	NetworkDefenseGuard, ReplayProtector, BitGuard, RoleLimiter
‚úÖ CNA Simulation Environment	SimStrategyAI, AutoSimExecutor, MalwareLabX
‚úÖ CNE Logging + Audit Trail	SecurityLogManager, SignalRouter, ThreatUplink
‚úÖ Cross-Chain Defense Dispatch	CADDispatcher, CERTResponder, PauseGuard
‚úÖ Chainwide Subsystem Registry	Tracks all active security objects (pause, replay, audit, upgrade filter)

‚úÖ 4. Solidity Code: CNOCoordinator.sol
This contract:

Manages registered CND, CNA, and CNE modules

Allows dispatch of security tasks

Tracks activity and execution per actor or module
