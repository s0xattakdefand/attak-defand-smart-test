📢 Term: Consent Banner — Web3 / Smart Contract + dApp Context
A Consent Banner is a UI/UX mechanism that informs users about data collection, cookie usage, blockchain wallet interaction, and asks for their approval before continuing. In Web3, this goes beyond traditional cookie consent and may include:

🔐 Wallet connection approval
📄 Signing warnings or terms acceptance
📡 Metadata/cookie tracking disclosure
🔍 Consent for off-chain data (e.g., IPFS, analytics, biometric)

It is increasingly important for legal compliance (GDPR, CCPA) and trust-building in decentralized apps (dApps).

📘 1. Types of Consent Banners in Web3 dApps
Banner Type	Description
Cookie Consent Banner	Asks permission to store analytics or session cookies
Wallet Connection Consent	Informs users about signing, gas costs, or address exposure
Terms of Service Acknowledgment	Requires users to agree before using the app
ZK Proof or Biometric Disclosure	Informs users about sensitive off-chain proof or data processing
Bridge/Data Consent Banner	Explains risks with cross-chain or off-chain message/data handling

💥 2. Security and Legal Risks Without Consent
Risk Type	Issue Example
Lack of GDPR/CCPA Compliance	DApp stores session cookies without informing EU/US users
Silent Wallet Hijacking	Auto-connect or silent signing without user knowledge
Replay Consent Violation	Signed data reused elsewhere without informing the user
Terms Violation	User claims they weren’t informed of dApp risks or terms
Data Leakage	IP address or biometric data stored without consent

🛡️ 3. Best Practices for Consent Banner Design
Practice	Implementation Strategy
✅ Explicit Consent (Opt-In)	Default to “off” for tracking or connecting wallet
✅ Multistep Wallet Consent	Show cost/signing details before wallet approval
✅ Terms Modal + Click Accept	Enforce modal before UI becomes usable
✅ Local Storage Consent Tracking	Store banner decision in localStorage/sessionStorage
✅ Sync with Backend or Smart Contract	Log timestamp, IP hash, wallet address upon consent

✅ 4. Code Example: ConsentBanner.tsx (React + Ethers.js dApp)
This banner:

Asks for terms + cookie + wallet consent

Disables dApp until accepted

Logs decision to localStorage
