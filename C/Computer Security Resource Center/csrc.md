🏛️ Term: Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
The Computer Security Resource Center (CSRC) is a public resource operated by NIST to provide cybersecurity standards, guidelines, practices, and tools. In the Web3 context, we adapt CSRC into a modular, on-chain/off-chain registry of:

✅ Security controls,
✅ Threat intelligence,
✅ Audit checklists,
✅ Exploit patterns,
✅ Response templates,
for use by DAOs, CERT teams, auditors, and developers building or maintaining secure smart contracts.

📘 1. Types of CSRC Content in Web3
Resource Type	Description
Security Control Templates	Role access, pause guards, upgrade safety, input validation
Exploit Pattern Registry	Standardized CFReDS bundles for testing (e.g., reentrancy, overflow)
Audit Checklist Modules	Static + runtime controls (e.g., OpenZeppelin checks, foundry invariant)
Threat Intelligence Feeds	Known attacker contracts, entropy drift logs, high-risk selectors
Governance Response Guides	DAO incident playbooks, rollback paths, quorum overrides
ZK / Bridge Security Modules	Reference verifiers, nullifier logic, message hash guards

💥 2. Threats Addressed by CSRC Resources
Threat Type	CSRC Resource Purpose
Smart Contract Exploits	Supply CFReDS exploit bundles + invariant test templates
Governance Attacks	Include quorum sanity checks + rollback governance patterns
Bridge Replay Attacks	Message ID guards, root pinning templates
Oracle Manipulation	Multi-feed threshold sample modules
ZK Replay / Drift	Nullifier guard + entropy scanner templates
Protocol Upgrade Hijack	Slot lock + simulation verification checklist

🛡️ 3. Defense Capabilities Enabled by CSRC
Strategy	CSRC-Style Resource Provided
✅ Template Libraries	RBAC patterns, upgrade guard templates, proxy checks
✅ Attack Replay Modules	CFReDS bundles + forge test --replay payloads
✅ Simulation-First Governance	Require simulations for proposals before vote acceptance
✅ ZK-Safe Templates	Prebuilt verifiers, nullifier guards, hash root commit logic
✅ SimStrategyAI Bundles	Evolving test cases against known bad behaviors (entropy, drift, reentry)
✅ CERT Plug-in Registry	Responders, detectors, incident loggers with public templates

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CSRCRegistry.sol
This contract:

Stores and manages reusable security control templates

Tracks resource authorship and usage logs

Allows CERT or DAO to install, audit, or revoke templates
