🌲 Term: Computation Tree Logic (CTL) — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computation Tree Logic (CTL) is a formal specification language used to reason about the behavior of systems over time, typically applied in model checking. It allows expressing properties like:

"On all possible future paths, this condition must eventually hold" or
"There exists some path where this condition always holds".

In Web3, CTL applies to smart contract verification, especially to prove temporal correctness, safety, and liveness of protocol logic across all possible execution paths — such as DAO voting, access control, state machines, or zkApps.

📘 1. Types of CTL in Web3
CTL Type	Description
Safety Property	"Nothing bad ever happens" (e.g., cannot mint tokens without role)
Liveness Property	"Something good eventually happens" (e.g., withdrawal always finalizes)
Existential Path (∃)	There exists some execution where a property holds
Universal Path (∀)	In all execution paths, the condition holds
Nested Temporal Logic	Combine sequences like "eventually" and "always" within conditionals

CTL formulas use operators like:

AX φ: in all next states, φ holds

EX φ: there exists a next state where φ holds

AF φ: on all paths, eventually φ holds

EG φ: there exists a path where φ always holds

💥 2. Attacks Related to CTL Violations
Attack Type	Description
Invariant Violation	A safety property fails in some path (e.g., totalSupply < minted)
DAO Deadlock	Liveness failure — proposal cannot be resolved in any future state
Reentrancy Divergence	Execution tree breaks expected "only-once" property
Upgradable Storage Drift	Future execution violates past-state CTL logic
Faulty Access Control Tree	Exists a path where unauthorized user gains control

🛡️ 3. Defenses Using CTL in Smart Contracts
Defense Strategy	How It Helps
✅ Formal Verification	Model contract in CTL or LTL to prove temporal correctness
✅ Foundry Invariants	Use forge invariant to simulate execution tree branches
✅ State Machine Guards	Encode transition conditions into logic (e.g., no jump from Paused→Minted)
✅ Runtime State Assertions	require conditions enforce valid transitions dynamically
✅ SimStrategyAI Path Fuzzing	Simulates all feasible paths over time to detect CTL violations

✅ 4. Solidity Code: CTLStateMachine.sol
This example:

Enforces valid state transitions

Asserts temporal properties like:

Only Initialized → Active → Terminated paths are allowed

No "revive" path from Terminated → Active
