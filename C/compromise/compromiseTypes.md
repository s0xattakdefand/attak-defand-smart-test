üîì Term: Compromise ‚Äî Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Compromise refers to any unauthorized disclosure, modification, or control of sensitive assets or systems, such as private keys, roles, contracts, DAOs, or off-chain infrastructure in a Web3 protocol.

In Web3, compromise usually involves loss of control over keys, contracts, or logic flows, often resulting in asset theft, governance hijack, or irreversible protocol damage.

üìò 1. Types of Compromise
Type	Description
Key Compromise (EOA)	Private key is leaked or stolen
Contract Compromise	Deployed contract has exploitable logic or backdoor
Role/Access Compromise	Admin, guardian, or plugin roles are misused or reassigned
DAO Governance Compromise	Attacker seizes quorum or delegates to control decisions
Oracle/Relayer Compromise	Off-chain actor submits fake data or messages
Bridge Compromise	Messaging relay or proof verification is bypassed

üí• 2. Attacks Based on Compromise
Attack Type	Description
EOA Drain Attack	Compromised signer is used to withdraw or approve malicious tokens
Logic Hijack	Upgradable contract compromised via delegatecall or storage overwrite
Backdoor Exploitation	Hidden function allows attacker privileged access
Reentrancy from Compromised Hook	Attacker exploits flawed integration with compromised module
ZK Proof Injection	Attacker relays invalid or malicious compressed proof
Governance Flash Attack	Flash-loan governance tokens to pass malicious proposal

üõ°Ô∏è 3. Defenses Against Compromise
Strategy	Implementation
‚úÖ Multisig Admin Control	Require quorum approval for critical actions (Safe, Gnosis)
‚úÖ Role Separation & RBAC	Use AccessControl to segment sensitive roles
‚úÖ Timelocked Upgrades	Delay contract upgrades or proposals for community inspection
‚úÖ Compromise Recovery Modules	Include pause, revoke, rollback, or key rotation logic
‚úÖ ZK or Hardware-Secured Keys	Use zkLogin, MPC wallets, or hardware signers
‚úÖ SimStrategyAI Drift Monitor	Detect behavioral or signature entropy drift after compromise
