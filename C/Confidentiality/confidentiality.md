### 🔐 Term: **Confidentiality**

---

### 1. **Types of Confidentiality in Web3 / Smart Contracts**

**Confidentiality** refers to ensuring that **data is only accessible to authorized entities**, and **remains hidden** from unauthorized users, contracts, or observers — including nodes and miners. In Web3 systems, confidentiality is enforced **off-chain** via cryptographic methods and **on-chain** via verifiable commitments or access guards.

| Confidentiality Type                | Description                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data-at-Rest Confidentiality**    | Keeps stored information (e.g., IPFS, on-chain hash) secret or encrypted.                     |
| **Data-in-Transit Confidentiality** | Secures communication between nodes or contracts using encryption or relays.                  |
| **Computation Confidentiality**     | Hides inputs and logic during execution (e.g., zkSNARKs, TEEs).                               |
| **User Confidentiality**            | Preserves privacy of participant identity (e.g., mixers, ring signatures, stealth addresses). |
| **State Confidentiality**           | Hides specific contract states like balances, votes, or strategies.                           |

### 2. **Attack Types on Confidentiality**

| Attack Type                        | Description                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **On-Chain Data Exposure**         | Storing plaintext secrets, credentials, or business logic directly on-chain. |
| **Transaction Graph Analysis**     | Analyzing address activity to infer behavior or identity.                    |
| **Replay of Encrypted Proofs**     | Leaking confidential data due to reused or poorly scoped proof.              |
| **TEE Breach or Fake Attestation** | If confidential compute is faked or its enclave is compromised.              |
| **Oracle Leakage**                 | Confidential data shared via oracle without protection or encryption.        |

### 3. **Defense Mechanisms for Confidentiality**

| Defense Type                             | Description                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**         | Prove a statement without revealing the data behind it.               |
| **Commit-Reveal Schemes**                | Commit hash of secret and reveal it later with integrity validation.  |
| **End-to-End Encryption**                | Encrypt messages/data using recipient public keys (e.g., ECIES, BLS). |
| **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)** | Secure off-chain computation zones like Intel SGX.                    |
| **Stealth Addresses / View Keys**        | Privacy-preserving address schemes in tokens or voting.               |

### 4. ✅ Solidity Code: `ConfidentialDataVault.sol` — Commit-Reveal with Confidential Hash Storage

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/// @title ConfidentialDataVault — Confidentiality-preserving vault using commit-reveal and hash-based proof
contract ConfidentialDataVault {
    address public owner;
    mapping(address => bytes32) public commitments;
    mapping(address => bool) public revealed;
    mapping(address => string) public decryptedLabels;

    event Committed(address indexed user, bytes32 commitment);
    event Revealed(address indexed user, string label);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not owner");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    /// ✅ Step 1: User commits to a secret (e.g., hashed label, password)
    function commit(bytes32 hash) external {
        commitments[msg.sender] = hash;
        emit Committed(msg.sender, hash);
    }

    /// ✅ Step 2: User reveals the preimage to prove they knew it
    function reveal(string calldata label, bytes32 salt) external {
        require(!revealed[msg.sender], "Already revealed");
        bytes32 computed = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(label, salt));
        require(commitments[msg.sender] == computed, "Invalid proof");

        decryptedLabels[msg.sender] = label;
        revealed[msg.sender] = true;
        emit Revealed(msg.sender, label);
    }

    /// 🔐 View-only access for admin to see revealed data
    function getRevealedLabel(address user) external view onlyOwner returns (string memory) {
        return decryptedLabels[user];
    }
}
```

### ✅ What This Demonstrates

| Feature                 | Security                                              |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commitment Storage**  | Only hash stored; no raw secret exposure              |
| **Reveal Process**      | Verifies possession of original secret (label + salt) |
| **Authorization Bound** | Only owner can view revealed results                  |
| **Replay-Resistant**    | Commitments are one-time unless explicitly reset      |
| **Event Logging**       | Commitment and reveal steps are audit-traceable       |

---

### 🧠 Summary

**Confidentiality in Web3** ensures that:

* ✅ **Secrets are never exposed** directly on-chain
* ✅ Access is **authorized and verifiable**
* ✅ Sensitive operations (like votes, prices, or balances) can be **proven without revealing**
* ✅ Cryptographic protocols like **ZKP, TEE, ECIES**, and **commit-reveal** enhance private workflows
