🧪 Term: Computer Forensic Tool Testing — Web3 / Smart Contract Security Context
Computer Forensic Tool Testing refers to the evaluation and validation of forensic tools to ensure their accuracy, reliability, and completeness in detecting, analyzing, and reporting security-related evidence.

In Web3, this means rigorously testing smart contract analysis tools, transaction replay systems, anomaly detectors, calldata fuzzers, and blockchain forensic engines to ensure they:

Detect malicious behavior

Reconstruct exploit paths

Validate state changes

Identify vulnerable patterns

📘 1. Types of Forensic Tool Testing in Web3
Tool Testing Type	Description
Transaction Replay Testing	Verifies that forensic tools reproduce historical exploits accurately
Calldata Pattern Matching	Tests if tools can detect malicious selectors or entropy drift
Storage Drift Analysis	Validates correctness of state diff snapshots before/after attack
Anomaly Detection Accuracy	Assesses false positives/negatives in detection systems
Event Log Validator Testing	Ensures forensic tools reconstruct logs emitted during exploit sessions
Selector Fuzzer Evaluation	Checks tool's ability to mutate and find unknown function paths

💥 2. Attacks That Must Be Detectable by Tools
Attack Type	What Tools Should Detect
Reentrancy Loops	Internal call stack depth, fallback events
Gas Grief / Loop Bomb	Abnormal gas consumption + infinite loop indicators
Backdoor Function Trigger	Rarely used selector or strange role switch trace
Replay of Proofs / Messages	Reuse of calldata with reused msgId or signature
Storage Corruption (Proxy Drift)	Change in critical storage layout between upgrade commits
Governance Spam Injection	Repeated low-value proposals with near-zero participation

🛡️ 3. Defenses & Validation Tactics via Tool Testing
Defense Strategy	Tool Evaluation Task
✅ CFReDS Bundle Replay	Run tools against reference exploits and confirm detection
✅ Simulated Fork Testing	Validate tools on Anvil, Tenderly, or Foundry forks
✅ Selector Entropy Scanning	Evaluate ability to identify drifted or spoofed selectors
✅ ZK Drift Trace Detection	Test zkProof analyzers on known proof shape leakage
✅ Automated Invariant Testing	Evaluate tools on whether they catch state invariant violations
✅ Noise Filtering	Measure false positive rates under normal user traffic

✅ 4. Solidity Code: ForensicToolTestHarness.sol
This test harness:

Simulates known attack flows (reentrancy, backdoor, loop)

Emits logs to validate detection

Supports replay via calldata and emits per-step forensic events
