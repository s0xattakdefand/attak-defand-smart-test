You will find a quickstart guide in the readme. WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box. IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions that access memory in an unsafe way. NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires additional logic that is not supported by this library.",

The tree and the proofs can be generated using our https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/merkle-tree[JavaScript library]. You will find a quickstart guide in the readme. WARNING: You should avoid using leaf values that are 64 bytes long prior to hashing, or use a hash function other than keccak256 for hashing leaves. This is because the concatenation of a sorted pair of internal nodes in the Merkle tree could be reinterpreted as a leaf value. OpenZeppelin's JavaScript library generates Merkle trees that are safe against this attack out of the box. IMPORTANT: Consider memory side-effects when using custom hashing functions that access memory in an unsafe way. NOTE: This library supports proof verification for merkle trees built using custom _commutative_ hashing functions (i.e. `H(a, b) == H(b, a)`). Proving leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires additional logic that is not supported by this library.\",\"errors\":{\"MerkleProofInvalidMultiproof()\":[{\"details\":\"The multiproof provided is not valid.\"}]},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":\"MerkleProof\"},\"evmVersion\":\"cancun\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":false,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[]},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/Hashes.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x8cbd338f083224b4b6f0ff42cbda641a0a6c31ffcdca197452b97fe4d0918269\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://f517dec5ba0c6491395acbf7f1d621f4e89e8f218bf5303c867b1c5ad70c6b11\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmWmXHRLEw8W6ckth7NyYTU88YfvuS7xSsfae5ksL8qNUe\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/cryptography/MerkleProof.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0x36a0c409c437a753cac9b92b75f93b0fbe92803bf2c8ff1517e54b247f166134\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://0f91ba472de411aa557cdbf6560c40750d87bd11c9060bc04d2ba7119af9d5a6\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmQjtYo2i7dDvzCEzZ67bDoNSG4RrwMoxPWuqFmX5Xzpuw\"]}},\"version\":1}",

Proving\n leaf inclusion in trees built using non-commutative hashing functions requires\n additional logic that is not supported by this library."

The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in memory with the default hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves elsewhere."

The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in memory with a custom hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves elsewhere."

The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in calldata with the default hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves elsewhere."

The reconstruction\n proceeds by incrementally reconstructing all inner nodes by combining a leaf/inner node with either another\n leaf/inner node or a proof sibling node, depending on whether each `proofFlags` item is true or false\n respectively.\n This version handles multiproofs in calldata with a custom hashing function.\n CAUTION: Not all Merkle trees admit multiproofs. To use multiproofs, it is sufficient to ensure that: 1) the tree\n is complete (but not necessarily perfect), 2) the leaves to be proven are in the opposite order they are in the\n tree (i.e., as seen from right to left starting at the deepest layer and continuing at the next layer).\n NOTE: The _empty set_ (i.e. the case where `proof.length == 1 && leaves.length == 0`) is considered a no-op,\n and therefore a valid multiproof (i.e. it returns `proof[0]`). Consider disallowing this case if you're not\n validating the leaves elsewhere."
