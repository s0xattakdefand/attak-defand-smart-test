### 🔐 Term: **Shared Secret (Byte String for Key Derivation)**

---

### 1. **Types of Shared Secrets in Smart Contracts**

A **Shared Secret** is a **pre-agreed or computed byte string** used between parties to derive secret keying material, typically for authentication, encryption, or access validation. In Solidity and Web3, while native encryption isn't directly supported, shared secrets are often used via signature validation, off-chain derivation, or Zero-Knowledge proofs.

| Type                         | Description                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Off-chain Derived Secret** | Shared secret derived off-chain (e.g., using ECDH) and used for signature generation or proofs. |
| **Commit-Reveal Secret**     | Shared secret committed on-chain via a hash and later revealed for verification.                |
| **ZK-based Shared Secret**   | Zero-knowledge proofs that confirm knowledge of the secret without revealing it.                |
| **Pre-shared Secrets**       | Static secrets (e.g., hashed passwords, salts) shared between protocol participants.            |
| **Signature-derived Secret** | A byte string derived from ECDSA-signed message payloads, often with nonces or timestamps.      |

### 2. **Attack Types on Shared Secret Usage**

| Attack Type               | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Front-running Reveal**  | Attacker watches network and reveals before the honest party.                          |
| **Replay Attack**         | A valid shared secret or derived key is reused maliciously.                            |
| **Brute Force Guessing**  | If the preimage space is small, attacker can guess the shared secret.                  |
| **ECDSA Signature Drift** | Manipulated signatures or misconfigured `ecrecover` logic lead to unauthorized access. |
| **Hash Collision Abuse**  | Weak hash functions allow two different secrets to yield the same hash.                |

### 3. **Defense Types for Shared Secret Mechanisms**

| Defense Type                    | Description                                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Commit-Reveal with Deadline** | Prevent front-running by delaying secret usage.                                 |
| **Replay Protection**           | Use one-time-use salts, nonces, or deadlines.                                   |
| **Strong Hashing**              | Use SHA-256 or Keccak-256 instead of weak functions.                            |
| **ECDSA Validation**            | Validate signer using `ecrecover()` safely and check against allowed addresses. |
| **ZK Proof Validation**         | Off-chain proof systems to validate shared secret possession without leakage.   |

### 4. ✅ Solidity Code: Commit-Reveal with Shared Secret Derivation

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/// @title SharedSecretCommit — Commit-Reveal Pattern with Shared Secret Hashing and Replay Protection
contract SharedSecretCommit {
    address public owner;
    uint256 public commitDeadline;
    bytes32 public committedHash;
    bool public revealed;

    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public usedSecrets;

    event SecretCommitted(bytes32 indexed hash, uint256 deadline);
    event SecretRevealed(address revealer, string secret);

    modifier onlyOwner() {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Not authorized");
        _;
    }

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    /// Step 1: Commit secret hash (e.g., keccak256(abi.encodePacked("mysecret", salt)))
    function commitSecret(bytes32 hash, uint256 delaySeconds) external onlyOwner {
        require(committedHash == bytes32(0), "Already committed");
        committedHash = hash;
        commitDeadline = block.timestamp + delaySeconds;
        emit SecretCommitted(hash, commitDeadline);
    }

    /// Step 2: Reveal secret string + salt (off-chain computed)
    function revealSecret(string calldata secret, bytes32 salt) external {
        require(block.timestamp >= commitDeadline, "Too early");
        require(!revealed, "Already revealed");

        bytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(secret, salt));
        require(hash == committedHash, "Invalid secret");
        require(!usedSecrets[hash], "Secret reused");

        usedSecrets[hash] = true;
        revealed = true;

        emit SecretRevealed(msg.sender, secret);
    }

    /// Derive a shared key off-chain from secret string using HKDF or similar
}
```

### ✅ Notes:

* **Shared secret** is computed as:
  `keccak256(abi.encodePacked(secret, salt))`
* Can be derived from **ECDH**, **signed message**, or **user input**
* **Off-chain usage**: Use `secret` to derive symmetric key via HKDF or PBKDF2
* Replay protection: `usedSecrets[hash]` ensures one-time use
* Delay prevents **front-running reveal attack**

---

### 🔐 Integration Ideas:

* Use with **ZK-Proofs**: e.g., Semaphore or MACI to prove secret knowledge
* Use with **MetaTx**: signer provides shared secret in EIP-712 context
* Use with **Encrypted Payload Decryption Keys** on client side
