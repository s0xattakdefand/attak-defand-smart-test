### 🔐 Term: **Zero Trust**

---

### 1. **Types of Zero Trust in Smart Contracts**

**Zero Trust** in smart contracts refers to a design paradigm where **no actor, address, or input is inherently trusted**, even if they originate from within the system. Every interaction must be **explicitly authenticated, authorized, and validated** — regardless of source.

| Type                           | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Address-Based Zero Trust**   | No address (EOA or contract) is assumed trusted without proof or role assignment.                  |
| **Call Context Zero Trust**    | Enforces checks on `msg.sender`, `tx.origin`, and intermediate proxies.                            |
| **Signature-Based Zero Trust** | Requires cryptographic proof (EIP-712, zkSNARK, multisig) for any sensitive action.                |
| **Module Isolation**           | Each contract/module has its own permission boundary, even within a system.                        |
| **Data Provenance Zero Trust** | Every data input (or oracle feed) must be verified and timestamped or hashed.                      |
| **Upgrade Zero Trust**         | Treat upgrades and logic injection as potentially malicious — use logic anchoring, rollback tests. |

### 2. **Attack Types in Systems that Violate Zero Trust**

| Attack Type                       | Description                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Implicit Trust in Owner/Admin** | One compromised address can destroy the system.                      |
| **Trusted Proxy Injection**       | Delegatecall or fallback routes into a malicious module.             |
| **Oracle Feed Hijack**            | Blind trust in oracles allows attackers to manipulate pricing.       |
| **Upgrade Takeover**              | Assuming upgrade actions are safe without verifying signer or logic. |
| **MetaTx Spoofing**               | Unsigned or replayable meta-transactions executed blindly.           |

### 3. **Defense Types in Zero Trust Systems**

| Defense Type                         | Description                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** | Only defined roles can execute logic.                                   |
| **Proof-Based Execution**            | Require off-chain proof (EIP-712, zk, signatures) to authorize actions. |
| **Reentrancy & Input Guards**        | Enforce order, limits, and input structure.                             |
| **Multisig Verification**            | Require multiple signers for upgrades or withdrawals.                   |
| **Immutable Anchors**                | Lock core configuration at deployment (`immutable`, `keccak256`).       |
| **Circuit Breakers**                 | Automatic failover on anomaly detection.                                |

### ✅ Zero Trust Principles Applied

| Principle             | Defense Mechanism                                     |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **No Implicit Trust** | No function assumes caller is trusted                 |
| **Proof of Identity** | All access requires a signature                       |
| **Replay Protection** | Hashes cannot be reused (`usedProofs`)                |
| **RBAC**              | Role-gated sensitive functions (`grantRole`, `pause`) |
| **Isolation**         | No cross-contract trust assumed, no delegatecall used |
| **Fail-Safe**         | `pause()` acts as circuit breaker on anomaly          |

---

### 🧠 Summary

**Zero Trust in Solidity** means:

* All identities must prove themselves
* All calls must be verified
* No part of the system trusts another without validation
* No function should depend on assumptions about the context or caller
