### explain 
```bash
        - RequireChecks: 🧠 Explanation (Like You’re 5)
    The candy box can only be opened by mom after it’s full of candies.
    If a kid tries to open it, it says “NO!”
    If mom tries when it’s not full yet, it says “WAIT!”
    But once full and mom opens it — the candies come out 🍬
